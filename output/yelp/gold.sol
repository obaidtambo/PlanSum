they offer the best service for the price . the owner is a really nice guy who listens to your needs and will take care of any issues you have . overall a great environment and service you can trust to get your car looking clean and beautiful again .
the service here is hit or miss . sometimes you get a good tech and they do an awesome job . sometimes you get one that ' s not so great and the nails come off or break . there are a large variety of polish colors to choose form an the prices are fairly reasonable . they offer nail services as well as waxing .
the servers are kind and knowledgeable , they will patiently answer your questions . they offer patio seating if you ' d prefer to sit outside . the free chips and salsa are always a plus , and the margaritas are amazing too . the menu is full tasty authentic mexican dishes .
the drinks here are well priced , especially during happy hour . there is a large variety or regulars from various backgrounds and ages . great place to meet new people . the staff are great they provide a nice judgement free environment and they aren ' t stingy on the pours .
oh wow , this place is amazing . food here is way above what you ' d expect . it ' s not in the biggest area with foot traffic , so it ' s a bit hidden , but you know what they say , hidden gems are the best . service was friendly , quick and when they came out with the delicious food , it was overall a great experience . definitely love this place and you gotta try the tacos , they are delicious .
the staff here are friendly , engaging , and knowledgeable . it ' s a bit expensive but the exhibits are well done , and there are chances to interact with some of the animals . you can feed the stings rays , and touch them too ! the sharks can swim right over the top of you via an overhead tunnel , it ' s a great view . if you want more informative experience you can pay for a tour .
this doctor is great at providing some professional care and has a helpful team as well . the team works hard to make sure that you feel comfortable and understands how some people have some initial reservations and fears about going to doctors . the office is also extremely clean , which just shows how much they care about making sure they provide the best care possible .
hit or miss . it ' s a casino , so it stinks of smoke . buffet is kinda bad and way overpriced for what you get , which isn ' t that great to begin with . rooms here are clean if you ' re staying in the hotel but they aren ' t fancy or anything . i think there are better things to spend on . not saying it ' s bad , just not great .
oh man , this place has massive portions . i mean , that right there makes it worth going here . the shawarmas are delicious . i can ' t comment on other food , but the falafel too was good . yeah the price point is a little high , but for what you get it ' s definitely worth it . i ' ll definitely be coming back again to eat here .
this place is extremely busy and it leads to some somewhat poor customer service . the staff does wind up working very hard , but ultimately they are just short staffed and need more people to keep up with the volume of customers . the shop is very large though and generally they will have what you want in stock . it can be a fun shopping experience but i just highly recommend that you visit them on a weekday or some other time when they are not that busy .
it was a really long wait for a simple smoothie . the pesto lasagna was good though and the service was great as well . a bunch of vegetarian options as well made my day .
this place is pretty cool ! its a great sports bar with food that will fill you up completely . its nothing fancy , but that ' s okay because the food is flavorful and delicious . i had the buffalo burger and could barely move when i was done i was so full !
if you are hungry and in need of a sushi burrito spot , this is the place to go . you can actually choose from a sushi burrito or a poke bowl . they definitely make sure you are full when you leave because each option is loaded with tons of rice . every option is filled with many unique flavors that will have leave the place with a full stomach .
taurus is a pretty good moving company . i had tons of stuff in my apartment and they helped me get everything out in a couple of hours . they were a big help . it was a little annoying that they didn ' t answer my first online inquiry , but they ended up responding after i called and i ' m happy they did .
i ' ve gotta say , their pizza is absolutely amazing . i can ' t really fault anything about this place . their deep dish pizza is awesome . all i can say is that while their pizza sizes , especially deep dish might look small , it does not disappoint on flavor and filling . they really are deep dish . they also have a halal option which is impressive as far as pizza places . the employees here and friendly and really nice . service is top notch .
like most places , when this first opened it was excellent . slowly though it has been going downhill and quality has been getting worse . the gyro meat doesn ' t seem fresh and kind of weird looking . i ' d say avoid the gyros because they are pretty bad , but their other food is pretty good . service is ok too . i was a little disappointed because i expected better from a family run business .
although the food is a little pricey , it ' s a cute little restaurant with a good ambiance . their food is good , not fantastic , and the restaurant has an upbeat atmosphere . as a plus , they also have good service and the restaurant is pretty consistent in terms of quality and service .
the food here is fantastic , easily the best sub sandwiches in the arizona area . the staff are extremely friendly and will always go above and beyond in creating a delicious sandwich for you . the shop is local and family run , so i definitely choose it over a lot of the large national chains that are all around town . you will not be let down by the great food that they make here !
yummy and delicious catfish . you gotta try it . friendly staff and service is good too . you can tell they know their seafood and how to prepare and cook it to perfection . the staff also answered any questions i had . the hush puppies are tasty too .
this is a really good italian restaurant . they have some delicious pizza ! it just has a unique flavor that you can ' t get anywhere else ! they also have delectable pasta and salad to eat . i definitely will be coming back for more !
not a great experience here . felt like i was back in high school being bullied . real pushy and they get rude if you don ' t do what they say or listen to what they say . definitely try to take advantage of women which is shameful behavior . really suspicious behavior . i ' m sure others might have had good experiences , but i did not . felt like i was in the middle of a scam attempt .
their buffet is worth it . it changes daily and is the same price every day . not the friendliest people here though and food , which authentic , might not be to suited to all tastes . there is a bar here which is nice , albeit small , but comfortable . not too expensive considering what is offered .
this is a decent place to go for chinese food . i really like the beef noodle soup . it has the perfect amount of salt . i wish the place wasn ' t so small and stuffy . i just didn ' t feel comfortable at all . next time i ' ll just place a to go order .
the ramen here is absolutely wonderful . as good as saying it might be the best i ' ve had in a long time . they don ' t add msg to their broth which is really awesome because some people are sensitive to msg . quality is nearly always top notch here . definitely coming here again .
so this place is just average . the service is pretty bad and there are some questionable rumors going around . on the plus side , the rooms are pretty good and nice for the price you pay . they have hdtvs too now which is a plus , not some old school crt tvs . the pool is nice and relaxing .
wow , where to start with this place ? delicious pastries and food ! yummy cakes , yummy macarons and eclairs . i can tell they care about their food and put all their effort into creating delicious foods . they also have other things like coffee , etc , but i never tried to the coffee . i ' m sure it ' s good though . you can go here and just never run out of things to try , there ' s so much stuff .
appointments can be rescheduled due to weather , but it ' s worth it to make the time . they offer a great opportunity for adventure , and will provide a memorable experience . the staff can be hit or miss but are generally knowledgeable and fun to work with . they are willing to work with you on any accommodations you might need . they will also give you some history of the area and recommend you some other activities to do if you ' re interested .
this place makes probably the best sushi in all of arizona . they give you a good value for your money , but the prices are a bit high . the staff and owner are extremely friendly and willing to help you pick out some sushi that you will love . all of the food comes out fresh , and i would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to try some sushi !
this restaurant is a little bit overpriced , but when you get something that comes out perfect it ' s often worth it . the menu options are rather meat heavy and are a bit limited for people that are vegetarians though so keep that in mind . other than that though they make some great entrees , their cakes that are made in house are fantastic , and the truffle fries are a real treat as well !
this is without a doubt the best burger in toronto . no one even comes close to having what they have . they have a variety of options to choose from on burgers and have an amazing selection of milkshakes . the nutella milkshake is an absolute must for any first time visitor here .
the food is amazing , workers are some of the friendliest i ' ve experienced and seemed happy to see me . if i had to leave a complaint it would be that the lamb wasn ' t the greatest and even a bit fatty . definitely the place to go if you ' re looking for a great atmosphere as well as a great sandwich or kebab .
service can be a little slow here . the noodles are really good . i think it ' s a bit expensive though for what you get . there are other places that are cheaper but i don ' t know how they taste , so i can only comment on here . it ' s definitely worth checking out though . i had to wait a bit for my food but still pretty good experience .
pretty standard mexican joint . good service but parking can be difficult . chips and salsa were both great . warm atmosphere as well .
great place with overall great vibe and atmosphere . the menu is also great . there is lots of fun to be had here and always busy . the employees are nice and friendly and the food is really nice , as is the drinks . you gotta try the cocktails .
this place is warm and friendly . makes you feel like you ' re actually wanted there in the first place . quick , friendly service and food is also really good . it ' s not the easiest place to find and looks pretty small , but once you ' re inside you ' re in for a treat .
wow , where to start ? some of the best sweet foods i ' ve ever had . i wasn ' t sure what to try , so i tried a few things , and oh my goodness they were delicious . that ' s not all though , they serve drinks too so i got a latte and that was good too . there is a lot of variety here to choose from that ' ll make any sweet tooth salivate . definitely a good place !
there are tons of places to visit here . not the cleanest city in the world and is really expensive in general to live and to afford things here . vegas is really unique and you won ' t find anything like it anywhere else in the world , but there are some problems with cleanliness on the streets and can appear to be a bit dirty . overall the unique experience is work it and so much stuff to do here .
the food and atmosphere here are fantastic . they have a very friendly and attentive staff that will always help you pair some of their great wines with your entree . the next time you want some dinner , or just to get some drinks and appetizers this is a great place to check out !
very friendly staff and place . you ' d expect a place like this to be vultures , but they are actually quite fair on how they treat you . selling jewelry here was easier than i thought and i got way more than i thought . definitely a good environment .
as far as mexican places go , this one is a really good one . been here a few times and not disappointed with the food or service . it ' s quite a fun restaurant too and good vibe all over . prices can be a bit high but there aren ' t too many places like this in town so you ' d expect it to be higher than normal .
this place is simply amazing ! its the best mexican spot in town . their tacos are delicious and full of flavor . they also have chips and salsa that is to die for ! the salsa is just delectable ! it has a sweet , tangy flavor that you can ' t find anywhere else . i highly recommend !
cool little place with good beers . they have some unique flavors of beer . the reviews on google were high so i figured it would be good and i was disappointed . there ' s a good vibe here and you can see people are really enjoying themselves . i was one of those people !
the food here is fantastic and the atmosphere is very warm and cozy . i highly recommend trying out their prime rib , it is cooked to perfection . also if you are in the mood for some great drinks the cocktails here always come out great !
they have yummy baked potatoes . they have different sizes . i ordered the big one . took a little while and i noticed there was no rhyme or reason to who was getting their food at what times . seems the kitchen might be a bit unorganized . other than that , the food was really good . they have some low carb options too which is cool . salad bar is nice too , has a lot of options .
the stylist i had was really attentive to my needs and desires , and listened to me . i was really happy with the whole experience , and while a tiny bit pushy , i can understand since they do want the best for you . this is one of those places where you come in , and you leave really happy , and keep coming back . i sure will .
i never knew ramen could be the kind of food i would go out to a restaurant and enjoy ! this place changed my mind ! there are many different ramen dishes to choose from . there are also many other options such as octopus rolls and sushi . if you ' re looking for something different , this is the place to go . the only improvement i can think of is that the service could be better .
the restaurant has good food and the staff is really helpful and friendly . if you need it , they ' ll take their time to explain options in depth . so if there are vegetarians in your life , the staff will also go over the options available for them and they ' re really knowledgeable about what ' s on offer ! really good experiences at this restaurant .
these people have amazing pies and pastries . you can tell they know what they are doing and have a lot of experience . the taste is really nice and they also have good drinks to choose from . it was busy here but service was quick and fast , so not really a slow down in busy hours . i ' m sure in slower hours it ' d be even faster . nice little gem here .

i ' m a big sushi fan and this place did not disappoint . they have many options that are fresh and full of flavor . the service is amazing as well . even when the place is packed we were still served quickly and in a professional , positive manner . i recommend the delicious sashimi .
this is the place you want to go when you are looking for a healthy good meal . the food is good for you and also high in quality . they use fresh ingredients in all their dishes nothing they make is frozen . the customer service could use a bit of work but i was willing to look past this because of the amazing food .
employees are very personable and knowledgeable . they will work with you and provide a comfortable , welcoming , low pressure experience . definitely a place you ' ll want to return to ! super willing to answer any questions and make sure you ' re completely satisfied with your experience . they also have a nice area where you can grab snack and drinks .
i went through the drive though and i noticed they got my order wrong when they repeated it back . the quality here is kind sub - par . donuts seem not to be fresh . they aren ' t that rude or anything , but it ' s the quality , or lack of , that bring this store down . if you ' re in a hurry and want just " ok " food then stop here .
ramen noodles are good here and good portion sizing , but it ' s crowded and that may or may not be a bad thing depending on what you want . everything is fast and came out fast , and there ' s a lot to choose from when looking at the menu . it ' s clean too , even though it ' s busy , so it ' s not some dump or anything .
this is an amazing tattoo place ! the shop is extremely clean and the tattoo artists are very talented . i don ' t want to get my tattoos done anywhere else ! if you really want a good job done , i recommend colin or jake , they are the best !
recently renovated , but the food is hit or miss . the food is often not very fresh and sometimes even rotten . even the coffee doesn ' t seem fresh . they are frequently out of menu items and the price seems expensive considering the inconsistent quality . staff are not very friendly or helpful either .
this is a great place to take the family shopping for the weekend . it is family friendly and has a great food court so that everyone can get what they want if you decide to have a meal while you are there . it is a clean outlet mall and has many higher end brands . overall a very good place to shop .
the food here is fantastic and served in large portions . this gives you some great value for your money , but sometimes i can ' t even finish the entire entree . the staff here is also very friendly , and are great at what they do . the restaurant offers fresh guacamole that is made table side and i highly recommend checking that out .
the food here is fantastic if you are in the mood for some chinese food ! the staff is very attentive to make sure to get the food ready quickly , and also makes sure that they get it done properly . everything i have tried has been made with fresh high quality ingredients , definitely recommend stopping by !
this is the place to go if you ' re in need of a good pho spot . there is a lot of good food to choose from , whether you ' re in the mood for a sushi dish , some stir fry chicken , or a vegetarian option . every mean is packed with veggies so you never leave feeling like you pigged out on something unhealthy . the look and feel of the place is pretty unique as well .
this place has some amazing , tasty steaks ! they are breathtaking ! the menu also has seafood options that are just as delicious ! the only downside is that its pretty expensive , however you get top quality meat for what you pay for . you won ' t even notice the price when your stomach is filled with the best seasoned meat you ' ve ever had .
i ordered delivery because i wanted some chinese food quickly and they made it to my house in a good times . they made a slight error on what i ordered and gave me something i didn ' t want . it ' s not the best place but it is good for what it is .
incredible and relaxing massages here . you get treated like you ' re special and the service is great . afterwards i felt like a new person because it was that good . the prices aren ' t too bad and you get what you paid for , and more . i ' ll definitely be going back because of the great service i received .
the cupcakes are pretty good . not amazing , but good . some people don ' t seem to like it but i feel that it just really depends on the person and what they are in the mood for . they have some unique flavors of cupcakes and quite a variety . price was a little on the high side , but this isn ' t a cheap place and that ' s probably why .
if you are looking for a great italian restaurant in the surprise az area this is the place to visit . the staff here is very warm and friendly . i would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great meal !
great place for bubble tea , lots of options to customize your drinks and toppings ! they also offer loose teas and milk teas . the desserts are nice as well , they offer mousse , macaroons , and pastries ect . the price point is fair , cheaper than some other local options . great atmosphere to meet up with friends and chat , but also relaxing enough to come in and study .
i had to have my windshield replaced so i came here . they have online quotes , but it can be less or more , so definitely talk to someone real for a realistic quote . both bob and chris are really helpful and seem to really want to help . you can tell they want their customers to keep coming back and build a loyal customer base . when i called chris on the phone he went above and beyond to help me . fast service too !

if you are in the market for some great fresh food this is a wonderful restaurant to check out . the food is authentically moroccan and they always have great specials that change every day . all of their kabobs feature excellent cuts of meat , fresh vegetables , and are cooked and seasoned to perfection . i also recommend trying their mint tea , it is amazing .
this place may be a doughnut shop but they serve much more than that . you can order a smoothie or tea , and with a bit of thinking you can even make it healthy . the doughnuts are of course awesome as they should be for a restaurant dedicated to them . some of the smoothies are made with powdered flavorings if you dislike that kind of thing but they are great . they seem to have off days every once and awhile because the last time i was there the doughnuts tasted pretty bad but that was just one visit and everyone gets a second chance .
if you ' re looking for a comfortable and inviting bar this is a great place to go . they have a lot of unique beers on tap that you will not find anywhere else . the staff here is extremely friendly , and after just a couple of minutes it feels like you are chatting with an old friend . the next time you want to head out for some drinks give them a shot !
this place is excellent . the staff and service were quick and helpful . there knowledge of the product was quite deep , and they were more than willing to answer questions and make sure customers left happy . if you are in town , this should be high on your list of locations to check out .
ok , so first of all , the food at blossom is amazing . its some of the most quality chinese food you ' ll ever eat . the fried flounder is crispy and full of flavor ! the atmosphere is pretty good too . the only bad thing is the fact that it will cost you an arm and a leg to eat here . but that ' s just the price you pay for quality food .
this is an amazing place to go to if your iphone gets damaged . i took my phone there last month and the fixed it very quickly , sometimes within 15 minutes ! also , the prices are prewtty good as well . when your iphone gets damaged , don ' t fear ! they got you covered .

dean & deluca wine room is one of my favorite places to go before or right after a movie . the selection is amazing . the prices can be a bit high on some items but they make up for it with atmosphere and ambiance . the outdoor patio is perfect to sit back and relax with a glass of wine and people watch . there selection rotates often but you can always find something good . the added music just sets this place that much closer to perfection .
this place was awful ! how do you screw up tacos ? the tacos i ordered tasted old and disgusting . the staff isn ' t very nice either . they always seemed rushed and are in no mood to help . place they need to fix the air conditioner in this place . i was sweltering hot !
they have an interesting and wide selection of food to choose from , which is really neat . however , the quality of the food is only okay , and i ' m not sure i can recommend going here . some of the food chews weird and is a bit pricey for what you get
the food here is terrific . i order something different each visit , and they always satisfy with fresh ingredients and quality japanese cuisine . service is friendly and amenable every time i come in , and the owners themselves are quite welcoming , too . restaurant itself is on the smaller side , so very large dinner groups might have trouble finding room . if you come here , expect excellent food for a reasonable price !
the staff here and friendly and helpful . they offer classes if you ' re interested in improving your coffee knowledge ! they pour your lattes for you personally and can do latte art as well . a step up from and more personalized than other local corporate owned options .
the steak is the must have dish at this restaurant . one small problem with the steak is that you want to order it cooked less than you would at a normal restaurant . they have the habit of going a bit over on the steak . the drinks are excellent and the stuffed mushrooms as appetizers were amazing . this is a classy place that is also romantic . the staff pays good attention to you here .
this place has some outstanding pizza ! for a reasonable price , you can make your own and put what ever toppings you want ! its a really chill atmosphere with a decent drink menu . i ' ll definitely be going back .
barrelhouse is an amazing place to eat or drink with people you love . the food here is delicious . one of the most delectable items on the menu is the harvest salad . it has blue cheese , lots of greens , pecans , and other stuff to give it that great flavor . they also serve burgers and seafood . if you ' re hear to get a drink or too , the bartenders are friendly and talented .
wonderful ! all around great service and the food was amazing . i wanted some good italian food as i haven ' t had in a while and this place delivered . i ordered the lasagna and it was amazing . great quality on everything .
awful dunkin donuts location . service is way too slow for what you order . it feels like you ' re waiting forever . seems the staff here are way too busy to even care . they mess up orders too . i honestly can ' t think of anything good to say about this place . the premade donuts are ok but you still have to wait for them ....
great place to go food authentic italian food . pizza is amazing , lots of topping choices and they aren ' t stingy with them . drinks and desert wont disappoint either . the atmosphere is pleasant , and provides a nice escape from the heat . staff can be hit or miss but the place is clean and they have some good happy hour deals .
my eyelashes have never looked better and its all thanks to this wonderful place ! everyone here is so professional , especially devon ! i plan on coming back whenever i need my lashes done .
food is pretty good but i question the quality . i don ' t think it ' s exactly fresh and not sure how they are storing their food in the back . service is pretty bad and the staff is rude if you don ' t listen to them and they don ' t get their way . time takes a while for pickup if you do takeaway so might be waiting a bit longer than anticipated .
pretty basic bar . claims to be country , but country it is not . i ' ve been to real country bars and it ' s completely different . the atmosphere here is mostly college students and the bar itself isn ' t the cleanest . yes you can hear country music in the background , but it just feels like you ' re walking into an everyday bar once you look at the staff and patrons . can be pretty bad on service too . not recommended . drinks are ok though , but nothing amazing .
looks really nice outside although inside not as nice . not saying it ' s bad , just externally more appealing . when it ' s busy there are too many kids running around though which might annoy some people . food is so so here , not the best you ' ll find in town , but good enough . get sat down really quickly though so not much waiting , but food isn ' t exactly piping hot when it comes out , so i feel it could be better . very friendly though .
staff are unhelpful when trying to locate an up to date online menu . food here is hit or miss and can heavily over or under seasoned , though it has improved from previous years . the food is just not always what you ' re expecting . the atmosphere is nice and they do provide a changing table in the restrooms .
good place on a good day , terrible place on a bad day . service seems to be getting worse and going downhill . the portion size is small and they take a while to bring the food out . the price itself is ab it too much for what you get .
this place is an outstanding sandwich shop ! there are so many amazing options . i try to get something different every time , but i really love the pastrami ! its filled with flavor ! if you ' re tired of the competition and want something new , this is the place to go !
nice place for birthday parties . they have an arcade and offer pizza , cake , and soda , as well as laser tag . plenty of activities to keep everyone occupied and the staff are nice and work well with the kids . the equipment is in good working condition , and it is a clean facility . you can get a good deal on unlimited days ($ 20 ) and they also have family play packages .
i needed a place to get my lashes done , and beyond beauty lashes was simply amazing ! my lashes looked gorgeous when i walked out . the staff is so talented . i will not go anywhere else to get my lashes done ! if you really want the best service , ask for jenny . she ' s outstanding !
this place is a pretty sweet tattoo parlor ! its very clean and the artists are amazing ! i got a dragon done on my lower back , and it looks so realistic ! i ' m coming back here for all of my tattoos ! if you want the absolute best tattoo experience , then i highly recommend terry !
this place is kind of weird . the food menu is odd and doesn ' t make much sense . the food can also be weird , as in it doesn ' t make much sense some of the combinations used . i wouldn ' t order online because they don ' t seem to get it immediately and your order can be delayed .
this place has a excellent price point , and the portions are generous . the kabobs are wonderful but there are many delicious options . the food is cooked and seasoned well . offers take out as well .
this place is just " meh ." i wish the menu had more options . i ordered the pizza and it looked burnt . the bartender didn ' t know any actual drinks other than beer . the atmosphere overall wasn ' t very clean . i just felt uncomfortable most of the time . i will not be returning .
they have a long list of meals but the sushi is wonderful and top of the list for things to get . the staff is very friendly and helpful but rush around a bit . the owner is also friendly . the place itself is average to below average .
