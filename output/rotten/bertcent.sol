robespierre has conceived something you do n't see every day : a feminist rom-com that unapologetically allows its flawed protagonist to let it all hang out ... but -lsb- it 's -rsb- one of those pictures that 's just good enough that you dearly wish it were better .
if it did n't come from a major studio , i would think the film is a satire of romantic comedies , or at least some kind of avant-garde experiment in testing the limits of audience identification

you 've seen more convincing medieval performances from guys at ye olde pancake house after a larp scrimmage . with all the dead birds and fish , this might seem like a timely piece of apocalyptic fiction . but such pestilence is annual par for nicolas cage .
the play , with all of its key surprises and biting exchanges intact , is up there on the screen . but given the depth and fascinating pull of auburn 's writing , that 's a good thing .
this is grim and witless storytelling , and what makes it so depressing is that it has n't improved by so much as a chemical trace since the days of the first rocky .
a brave film , and a surprisingly absorbing and finally affecting one , partly because it 's about that least american of trinities -- silence , solitariness , and the spiritual deepening impossible to achieve without both .
a well-intentioned , warm movie that becomes increasingly saccharine and silly .
is n't stylish escapism , but a psychological drama that touches on betrayal in the aftermath of incalculable tragedy , finding petzold in command of mood and reveals , while hoss delivers exemplary work in the lead role .
say this , in sum , for breathless : it is certainly no clich√© , in any area or sense of the word . it is more a chunk of raw drama , graphically and artfully torn with appropriately ragged edges out of the tough underbelly of modern metropolitan life .
at the base of its premise as a documentary , young@heart seems like a ca n't - miss proposition . but what really emerges is an essence and poignancy that goes beyond the black and white of just singing the rock songs .
ghibli 's latest is its most local and historical , like a gorgeous-looking manuscript plucked from a town 's archives . a school-film about personal space and preserving place in a japan on the cusp of a new era . but it 'll lack spark for any non-ghibli fan .

messengers with the worst possible message , they nonetheless manage to be human and alive ... . in a film that itself bears sad tidings about the costs of war , that is an affirming , even an inspiring , gift .
bela lugosi gives the performance of his life in a role that might have been written just for him . highly atmospheric throughout , this remains a milestone in horror movie history .
designed neither to warm your heart nor shelter you in the comfort of liberal guilt , the movie does what so many style-conscious , `` subjective '' documentaries have long forgotten how to do . it shows you a world , and stays the hell out of it .

one of the landmark tits and ass films of the eighties , and surprisingly a comedy with a lot of humor and even some heart .
... a european melodrama drunk on its own artistry . the mix of swinton 's cool and guadagnino 's fire makes for a unique cinematic experience .
the gangland plot is flimsy -lrb- bad guy peter greene wears too much eyeliner -rrb- , and the jokes are erratic , but it 's a far better showcase for carrey 's comic-from-uranus talent than ace ventura .

cronenberg delivers a cold , clinical and at times stagebound film in a dangerous method , but it 's one that will nevertheless keep you thinking about it long afterward .
hunt , who also co-wrote the screenplay from elinor lipman 's novel , scrupulously avoids anything that smacks of tv sitcom humor . this is admirable , but the result is one of the glummest romantic comedies in recent memory .

reverend billy is a charismatic presence , even if his shtick is too silly and the documentary too unfocused to motivate any serious change in the nation 's holiday spending habits .
compliance is a difficult film to watch -- walkouts have been reported at more than one screening -- but it 's also a calculating and intimate deconstruction of the greater social ills that our fast-food nation faces as a whole .
a visually ravishing , narratively crisp treatment that represents a major advance on the earlier installments ... not just a good harry potter movie ; it 's a good movie , period .
the story this six-hour film from italy tells is full of nuance and complexity , but it is also as accessible and engrossing as a grand 19th-century novel .

the sophisticated outrageous adult comedy we 've been waiting for all year . it 's smart , funny and has a charming message while hinting at joseph gordon-levitt 's seemingly limitless potential .
as raw and personal as a movie can be , the equivalent of a cinematic journal or diary . but it 's also artfully constructed and articulated , written , edited and musically designed with often jolting brilliance .

claims that the film is a social satire are as empty as br√ºno 's pretty head , there 's no arguing with the fact that the film is staggeringly rude and very , very funny . the laughs build and build : it 's like surfing a tidal wave of hysterical bad taste .
branagh 's ambitious take succeeds as a cautionary tale about true monstrosity : hubris and man 's inhumanity to man . but one man 's operatic style is another man 's unintentionally comical excess , and ... frankenstein certainly tempts fate ... -lsb- blu-ray -rsb-

add director werner herzog to the mix , a guy who knows a thing or a hundred about obsessive protagonists , and we 're in for quite the ride -- wild and weird and blackly comic .
complex , visually stunning , and pleasantly convoluted , this is a film that seems like it ca n't be confined to one genre and while time flows in one continuous direction mr. nobody makes it a point to constantly pedal in the opposite direction .
a complex , character-driven film that never allows its themes - madness , love , coming of age - to become reducible to pat formulae , or over-sentimentalisation .

damned if die another day does n't score , injecting some color and verve into a series badly in need of it . the story cracks and pops unlike any of at least the past six bond movies .
... a film that 's gorgeous to look at , but completely hollow and devoid of compelling characters .
the film is lovely in the way satyajit ray 's films are lovely . it sees poverty and deprivation as a condition of life , not an exception to it , and finds beauty in the souls of its characters .
pocahontas is the best-looking of the modern disney animated features , and one of the more thoughtful : it is about real issues , even if it treats them with naive idealism .

reminiscent of the legal thrillers of the 1980s and '90s , the lincoln lawyer is a slickly made , well-acted and executed morality play . ... even when the movie devolves into formula in the latter half , it still keeps you grounded in its characters .

a tale of obsession and abduction , self-delusion and sexual confusion , errol morris ' tabloid stands as an almost giddy affirmation of the old cliche : truth is stranger than fiction .
even if frank is a little too smitten with its own quirkiness , the film 's examination of what matters in music - fame , money , sanity ? - works as a kind of behind the music peek at a band 's struggle for identity and devotees .
the comedy is broad , cartoonish , and quite funny in a faux little rascals manner . the movie is almost completely derivative , but that 's part of the fun .
it 's a miracle : a tough , honest , bloody film set so far from the bright lights it feels as if it 's on a different planet , yet knowable and absolutely compelling from start to finish . fargo is great american movie-making .

for this remarkable 1967 comedy about man and his modern world , jacques tati attempted nothing less than a complete reworking of the conventional notions of montage and , amazingly , he succeeded .
it does n't coast on its premise but follows where it leads , which is into some serious territory . what might have been a joke with a tagged-on sentimental ending becomes instead a sensitive movie that affirms the value of life .
old fashioned western , a meditation on honor , courage and camaraderie , is well helmed and acted , but commercially , it might fall between the cracks : it 's too grown-up for young viewers and too familiar as a psychological western for adults .
what emerges from the bilious murk of first-time director laurence dunmore 's film is a sad picture of an intelligent and talented writer who opted for self-indulgence and gratuitous insult over anything more meaningful .
midnight cowboy 's peep-show vision of manhattan lowlife may no longer be shocking , but what is shocking , in 1994 , is to see a major studio film linger this lovingly on characters who have nothing to offer the audience but their own lost souls .

screenwriter alan ball is no stranger to daring stories , but in his awkward film directorial debut he seems unable to capture the soul of alicia erian 's novel -- and with a story like this , that 's disastrous .

the cave has a brisk b-movie efficiency , and not much space for bad acting , but it is blatantly derivative -- alien or predator in a cave .
m night shyamalan has fashioned a modern classic here , a chilly , intelligent , emotional ghost story that relies not on the obligatory gore and knifeplay for its many shocks but on glimpses of an afterlife that 's anything but angels and harps .

shocking in its day and still a genuinely creepy experience , director james whale 's primitive yet enthralling interpretation of mary shelley 's classic tale of man playing god is the most influential genre movie ever made .
if you 're wondering what 's missing from so many big-budget , effects-driven hollywood movies , the answer lies in j.j. abrams ' super 8 : heart and passion . what 's happening onscreen really matters to the young people in the story-so it matters to us too ...
-lsb- luna -rsb- deserves a better co-star than garai ... and a script that 's more than a recycled 1950s programmer about star-crossed lovers from the wrong sides of the tracks .
sure , the action 's there , along with his trademark amazing physical stunts , but in getting the hollywood treatment , a great deal of the fun stemming from chan and his `` antics '' has been lessened .

grease 2 is a bad movie that really does n't deserve much of a defense . there are moments in it that are so cringeworthy , one might think they were the reason fast-forward buttons were included on vcrs .
the jokes are often double-edged , the performances always spot-on . the way , way back does n't re-invent the teenage turning point genre , but faxon and rash offer a breezy new spin . you 'll see more inventive movies this year but few more endearing .
like all the best suspense films , `` jaws '' manages to somehow remain amazingly tense , even if you 've seen the film before . no wonder so many moviegoers went back for repeat viewings .
sometimes there 's a movie that comes along that shivers your timbres . pirate radio is one such delight . it 's a treasure trove of rock and roll memories , energy , and infectious spirit . it 's as groovy as the 1960s .
if not for the excessive melodrama , lousy dialogue , clumsy acting and generally nasty vibe , `` never die alone '' could have had the kind of distinctive edge that made urban street dramas like juice , menace ii society ...
valeria golino is appealing as cruise 's girlfriend ; hoffman makes his character pretty believable without milking the part for pathos and tears , and it 's nice to see cruise working for a change in a context that is n't determined by hard sell and hype .
though slow spots abound , the camp content of some scenes is astro-nomical and it reminds us of a more innocent time when the concept of death by sex was something we could laugh about .
a deeply moving film on many levels that wears its love for '60s music on its sleeve for what is ultimately a solid family drama .
quite extraordinary . gently comic , ultimately stirring , the nomadic world dvortsevoy chronicles pays loving attention to the lives of both humans and animals -- interdependent residents in a difficult , memorable part of the world .
this is n't my favourite genre , but it 's evident that the film delivers all the requisite elements for fans itching to sit through decapitations , body ripping and blood-soaked , tooth gnashing devourings directed in as fresh a way as is possible .
chiemi karasawa deserves all the credit in the world for the intimate and hilarious portrait that is elaine stritch : shoot me , a sparkling cocktail of music and memoir . on the other hand , she did n't exactly have to drag her subject out of her shell .
e l katz 's film delivers exactly what the title promises . it is a very bloody , very violent fairground ride of a movie that ratchets up the tension as its two hapless anti-heroes compete desperately for money .
the original french title of this flick translates as birth of octopuses , and it 's a more accurate description of the complicated relationships in this well-acted coming-of-age story , the impressive debut of filmmaker c√©line sciamma .
without too much knowledge or preconceived ideas , it would make me an easy mark for a polemic about modern privacy -- but poitras 's bracing , galvanizing new documentary about the snowden affair is n't that at all .
none of dahl 's gifts for dark humor or sparkling writing is evident . although the script is good , it is a direct descendent of all of the preceding bond scripts and breaks no new ground .
troubling , disturbing , this is put together with fine technique , but it plays almost as a heartless documentary , ignoring the obvious trappings of sensationalism .
cutie and the boxer is an often quiet , almost fragile piece of cinema that presents us with a spiky and unglamorous relationship , still full of love . it 's a beautiful and humane documentary .
spielberg 's first big drama is often hokey in places but ultimately succeeds .
a sturdy suspense story , set in stasi-infected east germany , rich in moral compromise , individual integrity and general desperation , it 's elevated by hoss to something sublime and unforgettable ...
whatever amandla ! lacks in cohesion is made up by the passion of those who lived through apartheid , and the power of their defiant , sad and joyous sounds .

this is a nice , safe , bond movie that is trying to please the masses . and it does work as a crowd pleaser . not among the best bond , but a solid debut for brosnan and a worthy entry in the series .
the plot is pure hokum from beginning to end , but throw the silver-tongued vincent price into any film as a tormented villain and you 've already won half the battle .
enjoyably trippy , brain-bending stuff , but the most satisfying thing about moon is that it marks a return to the notion of science fiction as a genre fuelled by big ideas rather than big special effects .
patrick stettner 's script is smarter than a three-piece suit , and stiles contributes a cool , crafty performance . but it 's hard to hold a candle to channing 's high-wattage turn .
director stephen frears manages to successfully walk the tricky line between comedy and dark drama . it keeps the audience off-kilter a bit , but in a good way ; we should n't always need to know what 's coming next , in terms of tone or plot .
the surprise gift of the season : a sharp , savvy holiday comedy that does n't get its laughs at the expense of those who start to glow in the early days of december . it 's a most entertaining package indeed .
very exciting , very witty , and elevated above its action-movie status by aldrich 's deliberate references to nixon in albert 's characterisation of the warden .
aware that a story of such grave human weight and consequence demands to be told exactingly if it is to be told at all , lafosse 's film succeeds most profoundly by refusing to phrase the inevitable question -- how could she ? -- as a rhetorical one .
pooh 's heffalump movie , with its message of tolerance and open-mindedness , is a fine afternoon at the megaplex . and it will make a welcome addition your home library when it 's released on video .

heroes , villains , desperados , and the inevitable shoot-outs : you 'll find them all in what a lot of fans consider leone 's best film .
a tactful and touching legacy for paul walker , `` furious 7 '' is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story , too . its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you 've never called yourself a franchise fan before .
a wonderfully uplifting and charming biopic that 's sure to win over all but the most mean-spirited . and the motorbike races really rocket , too .
this makes good on that old dogme promise by discarding the crutches of conventional movie drama and concentrating on the raw essentials of character and story .
as a mythic comic-book movie about a man at war with himself and the world , it 's unexpectedly intense and engaging . it 's not only this summer 's blockbuster creature-feature but it also cleverly fuses pop culture with psychodrama .
one of the great science-fiction films of all time , forbidden planet combines good drama with great special effects . and it has robby the robot to boot .
this multi-generational culture clash has some charm and gentle humor , but where face falls on its , um , face is in the lethargic pacing , inconsistent acting and unexplored relationships .
tears of the sun has a title that makes no sense whatsoever . the film 's message , on the other hand , makes too much sense -- it 's simplistic and reactionary and designed to get hearts pumping but not minds thinking .
the atmosphere , combined with sweet and lowdown 's entertaining momentum and zippy jazz score , makes it easy for you to get swept away for 90 minutes of great jazz and good fun .
an extended ethnic joke , kitchen stories moves with a glacial indifference to conventional comedic timing . but perhaps that 's what makes it so funny and so emotionally precise .
that jackson 's king kong upgrades the now hammy original with wit , heart and humour is a pleasant surprise . that it does so by reinventing the action blockbuster , in form and emotional impact , is nothing less than an act of cinematic alchemy .
if one defines a ` movie star ' as an actress/actor whose presence can carry , even elevate , a mediocre movie , reese witherspoon is definitely a movie star . despite the predictable plot and cliche stereotypes , her irresistable charisma makes it frothy and am
the granddaddy of a whole genre of action films still remains sharp , tough , and exciting .
designed to capture `` the hangover '' crowd , this wild and wooly comedy sneaks up on you . while it 's not the greatest comedy ever made , this one sure does offer up some pretty darn funny moments .
too short by half , lost boys of sudan affords frustratingly little by way of real analysis and history . but it does introduce us to two extraordinary young men whose faith in this country is almost as unbearably sad as their stories .
there 's some ghoulish humor in p2 , and a couple of scares , but it 's little more than the umpteenth variation of the woman-locked-in-a-house plot .

goldfinger remains the gold standard for the bond movies . recent entries ca n't compare to this lustrous thriller , a throwback to when the term `` thriller '' had meaning .
almost a model of what 's best in american independent cinema ... provocative but not exploitative , moving but not maudlin .
it may be ironic that it took a female director -lrb- and a foreign one -rrb- to turn philip roth 's novella into a melancholy probing of the sexual anxieties of an aging professor , splendidly interpreted by ben kingsley in a sharp , fearless performance .
the background work is smashing , though nothing like as detailed as pixar 's ratatouille and , if the screenplay does one thing decently , it is to make some sort of sense of a most confusing story .
like it 's subject , the film has an irascible charm . leigh strips away the myth of the vaunted artist ; the highly evolved being with special knowledge . he also avoids the clich√©s that come with portraying an artist of turner 's stature .
the saint suffers from some of the same plot inconsistencies , lapses in logic and outrageous stunts as their other films . but there 's no wit at work here , and most of the one-liners are tired sexual double-entendres .
this picture is such a hyperactive hodgepodge ... mostly because it 's cobbled together from three short japanese movies .
a lovely movie , one that allows its characters unexpected spurts of growth and regression , darkness and grace .
the whole of sunshine does not live up to the enthralling , provocative final act , but it is science-fiction that cares about ideas over special effects .

it 's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned indian film culture that allows americans to finally revel in its splendor .
character depth and stirring subtext is what books are for . adamson 's narnia adaptations remove all that pesky claptrap so that we can glide through a superficial reading .
chu ... does n't try to do much with a script that rehashes every dance-movie clich√© , with people getting served , bringing it on and stomping yards .
michael anderson 's direction could n't be more unimaginative and flat . a movie like this should be swimming in creative whimsy , and a sense of wonder . there 's nothing of that sort here .
the pleasant surprise about demolition man is that both the script , and stallone , are funny ; the film blends big-budget action and tongue-in-cheek humor in the way that last action hero tried , and failed , to do .
cameron crowe crafts one of his best films around the end-of-high-school ennui and the uncertainties that come with that time in your life , but say anything ... is aging faster than you might think , despite its many classic lines and moments .
superman iv : the quest for peace could be one of those ` so bad it is good ' movies for some people but i could n't even find it funny .
cho and penn do n't have the needed personality or comic identity to sustain a franchise and their non-drug humor is so crude and scatological that -- to say the least -- it leaves a very bad taste in the mouth .
the movie is so good at using its horror elements to explore deeper , less fantastical emotions . for all its bump-in-the-night suspense , the orphanage is ultimately as much about motherhood and grief as it is about apparitions and shadowy corridors .
when the movie gets heavy-handed about how -lsb- gibson 's -rsb- becoming a better person , all the comedy disappears and what 's left is swimming in mawkishness and bogus sentimentality .
a brilliant courtroom drama whose strength lies within the power of rose 's words and sidney lumet 's great direction -lrb- his debut -rrb- .
the filmmakers know how to squeeze a lot from only a little narrative , mendelsohn once again proves he 's the reigning king of ne'er - do-wells and reynolds has never been better .
to devote an entire feature film to making fun of another film 's universally acknowledged gay subtext seems to me good cause for said filmmakers to have a sit-down with their muse , because somebody 's been sleeping on the job .
it ticks the right boxes to be a hit - the tear jerking aspect being key to the word of mouth - but it 's a movie that rarely breaks out of it 's average confines .
at the end of courage under fire , you feel torn between admiration and annoyance with the filmmakers , who take an attention-grabbing premise and skillfully develop it into a conclusion that 's pure piffle .
sandler 's mischievous heart just does n't belong in a straight-up kid zone like bedtime stories , especially one with a script that does n't elevate beyond the expected .
there 's a little something extra in virtually every frame of invasion of the body snatchers , philip kaufman 's dazzling remake of one of the cleverest of horror classics .
good action sequences will satisfy the adrenaline junkies and lots of throwbacks to terminator films of yore will make the terminator fans happy . there are actually parts of a good movie in here , but the focus is in the wrong place .
this is a movie that is , at its root , a romance , wrapped up in an 80-year-old master director 's musings about what happens to us when we die .
it 's a fascinating , heartbreaking attempt to capture the overwhelming hugeness , and harsh growing pains of china 's exploding economy , by focusing on one family .
... a much-needed muckraking documentary that rakes the wrong muck - at least if the filmmakers hope to inspire change .
david zeiger 's superb documentary about the vietnam war era 's gi protest movement is jammed with incident and anecdote and moves with nearly as much breathless momentum as the movement itself .
a brilliant , though frankly overlong , exercise in filmmaking that creates a stunning portrait of a miserable corner of the world .
you 'd expect gondry 's version of a superhero movie to be either brilliantly creative or spectacularly misguided , and it 's neither ; just sporadically funny but more often plodding .
it 's not a great movie , but it is a beguiling one : a gallic version of american films such as doc hollywood or cars , in which a city-dweller opens up to life when he succumbs to the languid pace and the intense one-on-one relationships of the country .
he 's the best american filmmaker working today whom you 've never heard of : ramin bahrani has the exquisite talent of making the ordinary and the mundane soar into realms of rarefied and unexpectedly moving drama .
hersonski has done holocaust scholarship a great favor . just when we thought there were no new twists to the story of the warsaw ghetto comes this documentary : focused , sorrowful and revelatory .
could very well have been one primo slice of melodramatic manipulation with the right pair of actors . then again , i imagine that already happened -- back in 1968 .
a french language comic thriller terrifically acted and with dramatic devices that are familiar enough but still surprising .
the epitome of what a feel-good movie is supposed to be but rarely is , this one is beautiful to look at and life-affirming to think about , and it does n't have a pretentious bone in its head .
director peter strickland offers an affectionate , impeccably crafted salute to continental soft porn films of the 1970s crossed with something intense , theatrical and closely related to jean genet 's the maids .
all in all , the neverending story is a silly fantasy movie that often shows its age , but as a kids ' movie it still has enough exciting action and you-can-do-it attitude to earn itself a place in a family 's dvd collection .
dumb and dumber , which features carrey and jeff daniels as nitwits traveling cross-country , is a frayed string of gags posing as a movie . carrey , though , does literal-minded doofdom with peerless enthusiasm .
a mongrel of a movie -- scruffy , obvious and slightly disreputable ... the best one can say of it is that it could have been worse .
this movie is the worst kind of offender : it thinks its funny and clever , but it is neither . the filmmakers have mistaken banality for wit and silliness for humor , and that does n't begin to address how visually clunky this motion picture is .
while more entertaining as a gimmick than a film , spurlock still reveals telling truth about our fast food nation .
it 's great emotional fodder for old-school metallica fans and smart , tugging drama for people unfamiliar with the band .
a few years back , the easy sexism and narcissism of the james bond series looked dated to the point of obsolescence , but quantum of solace proves that a revenge motive is just what 's needed to rejuvenate all the bond cliches .
perhaps myers was so enchanted by his own desire to bring spiritualism to the masses that he forgot to actually bring the funny with it . whatever the case , this is a shockingly laugh-free motion picture .
`` after tiller '' takes the politically divisive , emotionally charged issue of late-term abortions and portrays it with grace , understatement and humanity .
it piles on the schmaltz and the lame attempts at humor so that we 'll see the film as a comedy with a big heart , a really big heart .
the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan 's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .
a film that 's charming , funny - especially when streep is on screen , broadcasting her superb impression of the tall , charismatic , high-pitched child - but leaves you with a dissatisfaction with modern life that no culinary masterpiece can relieve .
so long as you can adjust to the singular pace of the story-telling , then this film , which won ceylan the best director award at cannes last year , is a powerfully affecting piece .
this is the sort of asinine action exercise that needs a star to blow up cars and leap from rooftop to rooftop with gusto . so right about the time that travolta curses out the charles de gaulle customs staff , we know this movie has found a reason to be .
a real cannonball , a hardass drama about the drug trade that steven soderbergh directs like a thriller -- it comes out blazing .
this is a thrilling picture that merges -lsb- scorsese 's -rsb- gritty style and his adoration of old-fashioned hollywood . the production design alone makes the film a must-see .
easier to admire than it is to sit through , the french film 13 -lrb- tzameti -rrb- is an exercise in stylish depravity that may one day be viewed as the debut of a great filmmaker .
approaching it as fairytale with moral -- hepburn meets her prince but gums it up and need to rediscover her own humanity -- cukor directs with stylish elegance that serves the play perfectly ; it 's one of his masterpieces .
maverick is smart-alecky without being very smart . it 's full of spoofy , har-dee-har-har ribaldries -- this film practically winks at you .
ultimately , the film does n't entirely answer the massive ` why ' at the center of this story -- that answer died on that day in 1978 -- but it 's a haunting exploration of an event of unspeakable sadness , which still resonates decades later .
this feel-good family ensemble piece from director ron howard manages to avoid being oversentimental , and the result is an affectionate , leisurely comedy about the joys -lrb- and otherwise -rrb- of bringing up children .
some of the gags do land - maybe one in four . but the genre-parody genre with big stars and poop jokes needs a little more class than macfarlane is capable of providing .
it 's warm and open to the idea of sex , unlike other recent films -- such as romance , lies , fat girl and intimacy -- that purported to explore sex , but in the end were just as repressed as any hollywood movie .
... basks in a kind of golden mythic glow that is n't often seen in movies anymore , making it a film that 's hard for anyone but the most flint nosed to resist .
read my lips is not a heist film , a thriller , a twisted romance , a film noir or a character study , but a unique concoction that bends all these genres to its vision .
so many fascinating ideas are raised here that arcand 's decision to explore them within the context of a self-satisfied soap is disappointing .
a small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it is funny , scary and sad .
quietly shedding all the fussy baggage of ` heritage drama ' , campion gives us a moving account of keats ' great love and tragic death . a film of pictorial beauty and authenticity , graced with a fine cast .
the only thing bad about this movie is its title . once you get beyond that you find a feel-good , sports , coming-of-age , girl-empowerment drama immersed in a cultural adaptation story that works for all cultures and genders .
captivating performances and a well-honed , economical script that understands the power of images makes this potentially mawkish sexuality coming of age film both entertaining and insightful .
it 's true that great visuals , or a great story , or deeply unself-conscious acting can be enough to make us look past awkward dialogue . but sanctum is skimpy on those attributes .
a piece of often masterly image-making , a half-brilliant film with a revelatory lead performance by williams . but it 's also a thriller that gets trapped in surfaces : shiny , exciting , full of dread but often only tricks of the camera .
a perfectly adequate hollywood movie , even classy and entertaining at times , but , despite de palma 's brilliant set piece which reworks the odessa steps sequence from eisenstein 's battleship potemkin , this is disappointing stuff .
there is n't a lucid moment in it -lrb- and much of the dialogue is rendered unintelligible by russell 's subversive direction -rrb- , but it has dash , style , and good looks , as well as the funniest curtain line since some like it hot .
regarded by some as the best of the planet of the apes sequels , maybe even on a par with the 1968 charlton heston original itself , this third apes movie breathes fresh air into -lsb- the -rsb- series .
syrupy , dumb , and desperately unfunny ... cheaper by the dozen is the worst family film of the year , a sub-sitcom-level failure as abhorrent as it is half-baked .
while lazarescu is descending on his nighttime journey toward zero , the film builds up an entire social world around him -- one that is harrowing , funny , infuriating , outrageous and sometimes profoundly moving .
apfel is constantly chatting to `` albert '' off camera , not to us , and the affection adds an unusual meta level to iris ... that intimacy is the movie 's real subject ; it 'll make you feel swaddled in stylish conspiracy .
offside may be the ultimate iranian film : it 's both an advance for its director , moving away from his slight political didacticism , and a perfect metaphor for a population that 's more liberated than its stone-age sexism would imply .
for all its visual inventiveness , there 's something inert about the late jim henson 's 1986 fantasy adventure labyrinth .
through chronicling ceasefire 's attempts to quell street violence , the filmmakers show how violence causes a downward spiral of despair . this is n't an easy documentary to watch , but it is one which must be seen .
if the detective-story aspect of blood work fails to thoroughly captivate , the movie is nevertheless enjoyable for its constant stream of lively characters and the delight in watching a man with a bad ticker but a good head go through his paces .
documentaries can be informative , entertaining and provocative , but rare is the documentary that makes you feel so engaged -lrb- and enraged -rrb- that it prompts you to action somehow . tibet : cry of the snow lion is that kind of film .
the real movie is jessica alba as a blind girl ... even the story of an eye transplant recipient would be cool , watching her adjust to the world of vision . luckily , the bulk of the movie is that . that makes it classy and grown-up .
the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it 's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back .
as with many iranian films , reality and fiction collide -lrb- the lead actor really is a pizza deliveryman -rrb- , and the moral of the story is a surprisingly blunt critique of the growing inequality of wealth in the slowly westernizing nation .
guy ritchie 's noisy steampunk mauling of arthur conan doyle 's character is great galloping fun if ultimately slighter and less nervy than we might have hoped . still , robert downey jr. is great fun to watch and jude law has a clue .
dragon emperor does n't exactly beg for a sequel -lrb- neither did the mummy returns , for that matter -rrb- , but it 'd be fun to watch the filmmakers try to outdo this dizzy spectacle in the arena of sheer ridiculousness .
it 's intimidatingly intelligent , definitely not a time-waster , and challenges the viewer to keep up . but mashing in so many stories also serves to weaken the film as a whole .
austin powers seems to have made the broccolis gun shy about letting bond have too much fun , lest `` world '' be mentally lumped alongside an aggressively bawdy parody . sterile , sluggish and halfheartedly suspenseful , it 's the second-worst 007 film ever .
as a nightmarish vision of hell on earth , silent hill is a triumph of production and art design . as a coherent story , it 's little more than a string of video game scenarios .
the film , superbly directed by rafelson , shifts the late 1960s hippy drop-out genre into the ingmar bergman class : it 's cerebral , yes , but also moving and witty .
a classic tribute to an american pop-culture icon ... the first great comic-book movie and a nostalgic ode to the ideals of a more innocent time ... john williams ' swashbuckling score completes the grand experience .
like lore herself-fierce , defiantly unsocialised-it is a rebuke to notions of middle-class propriety , as well as a formidable work in its own right , by one of the best and most distinctive filmmakers this country has ever produced .
joe strummer : the future is unwritten is one artist 's moving tribute to another : director julien temple 's poetic evocation of the life of punk 's greatest troubadour .
youth in revolt is a little too clever and a little too willfully verbose for its own good , but it 's rare and a little wonderful to see a comedy about the sex lives of teenagers that suffers from an excess of ideas and ambition instead of a dearth .
theories of montage and eisenstein 's developments to the language of cinema to one side , potemkin is first and foremost a powerfully visceral film . its very lack of subtlety works in its favor . the film is not a meditation , it 's a shout .
this superbly played film , directed with remarkable skill for a first-time feature filmmaker , is truly an adult drama : it deals with the kind of compromises and sacrifices that , for better or worse , come with maturity .
freeway somehow manages to be hip , imaginative and hilarious . road film , comedy , prison drama and oliver stone 's natural born killers all rolled into one .
28 weeks later has a stronger story line -lsb- than the original -rsb- , equally fine performances , greater tension , enough gore to satisfy the most hard-core zombie fan , and a narrative pace that flings us from the opening scenes to the very last image .
big fish is a three-ring circus of sometimes outlandish situations and characters , yet burton makes it all seem so plausible ... that some part of you aches to accept .
traitor is smart , effective , and at times suspenseful . it 's one of a very few terrorist-themed movies that presents its situation without resorting to exploitation or oversimplification .
this is a slow , pretty , one-dimensional undertaking . the story is free of any real conflict or depth -- it 's just kind of big and shiny , not unlike an expensive hallmark greeting card .
the narrative is nothing more than a framework for scenes of unforgettable visual art . . it still comes across as the cinema 's best exploration of how stories are made in many a year .
but there 's no true spark of inspiration , the humor -lrb- especially its gag of subtitling a toddler 's babble -rrb- is thin and director brad silberling -lrb- `` moonlight mile -rrb- can never quite hide the fact that his kid actors are dull as dishwater .
it should mostly catch the attention of the younger set , but there are some gags left over for their parents -lrb- lots of slick cultural references and poo yuks -rrb- .
the mise-en-scene is appropriately suffocating , marked by scrupulous production design and rigid , geometric framing , yet a savage , liberating wit lies beneath the surface .
at times the film 's buddhist lessons feel a bit forced , but the naturalistic performances davaa has coaxed from a real-life mongolian family , and her intimate understanding of their culture and values , give this sensitive portrayal its heft .
ueto -- who was only a teenager when the film was made -- is no great actress , but her impressive agility and magnetic presence provide director ryuhei kitamura a perfect centerpiece around which to orchestrate his blistering ballet of blood .
the mountaineers climb for reasons that have little to do with nationalism - reasons the film clumsily attempts to articulate in words . it 's far more successful conveying those inspirations with stunning images of them scaling daunting heights .
in the longest tenure of any james bond performer , roger moore would certainly have higher highs and lower lows . and while it strays from bond formula in ways good and bad , it 's a fine introduction to a 007 more prone to crack wise than crack heads .
the real sacrilege is letting neophyte director rupert wainwright play minister to such a hopelessly convoluted script !
we do n't live here anymore is a revelation . one rarely sees american-made movies that are so unafraid to explore emotional cruelty and portray the consequences without positing easy answers or attaching happy endings .
john travolta and robin williams are no strangers to shamelessness . but not even they can walk away from `` old dogs '' with a shred of dignity - a mean-spirited , insulting `` family '' film that essentially pees down its leg and calls it comedy .
one flew over the cuckoo 's nest is an earnest attempt to make a serious film . but in the end the movie backs away from both the human reality and the cloudy but potent symbolism that ken kesey found in the asylum .
a gimmicky one-joke effects comedy that 's even worse when it tries to be sweet , fuzzy and -- heaven help us -- instructive about what 's really important .
the movie would be an unbearably grueling endurance test for the audience and the hero were it not for the arid beauty of the great steppe and the sweep of the battles , rendered with splatters of gore that lend a jackson pollock-like excitement to -lsb- it -rsb- .
a gloriously overproduced b movie -- loud , fast , gorgeously shot , brimming with bright pop-art colors . it 's also deliberately and defiantly absurd -- not in the least because it 's ultimately a spy kids movie for adults .
although it 's not essential for a filmmaker to insert their own experiences and opinions into a documentary that chronicles the lives of other people , crystal moselle 's `` the wolfpack '' proves to be a confounding exception .
crystallized by the functional - rather than fantastic - turns by its two leads , the time traveler 's wife never really takes flight . while the film makes a decent enough date movie , you 'll find it will disappear from your mind before too long .
new hollywood moguls spielberg and lucas teamed up to create the first -- and best -- of their extremely popular plunderings of old adventure serials ... in retrospect , it also appears as a precise pop-culture inauguration of reagan-era retro americanism .
wise 's original was an alarming cautionary tale , full of menace and stern warnings . the remake , as befits our times , coddles the audience , assuring us all this bad stuff will eventually work itself out . and hey , let 's all go to mcdonald 's !
the ref is one of those rare movies that seem to have everything going for it -- a promising director , terrific actors and an original , unapologetically grown-up script -- yet somehow still turns out to be a phenomenal drag .
daddy is more than happy to go for potty-training humor rather than real jokes ... but kids are n't likely to mind , and should be laughing straight through to the blooper-filled closing credits .
the french fantasy adventure the city of lost children is a dark phantasmagoria so visually amazing and provocative -- yet dense and confusing -- that viewers may need to see it more than once to take it all in .
new year 's eve is pretty much laugh-free , trading on tired visual gags and some unbelievably cynical ` cutesy ' scenes -lrb- baby montage anyone ? -rrb- for most of its humour .
so seamless and relentlessly powerful that the social-realism of not just this film , but the genre itself , is pushed to its limit . acting and action that rips so deeply , you 'll feel you 've got to do more than simply watch .
this romantic thriller about magic is bizarre , but theca n't lush prague setting and grogeous costumes can compensate only up to a point for the senseless , silly plotting .
this music-driven melodrama aims to salute and promote a cultural phenomenon -- reggaeton music , in this case -- by slathering it all over an instantly forgettable , clich√©-laden pop flick .
if you 're a video game geek and/or a stoner , grandma 's boy is n't a comedy -- it 's a documentary . for everyone else , it 's an interminably flat , one-joke movie with admittedly a couple of decent laughs .
predestination is a befuddling beauty , so rich in concept yet lacking in approach . there are more plot-twists here than m. night shyamalan could shake a stick at , but the unfortunate factor is that each one only becomes more predictable than the last .
the young ladies all perform well , the script is like a well-built tear-duct milking machine , and parents should be pleased their kids are going to see such well-intentioned drivel instead of the mean-spirited drivel that 's far more prevalent .
ridley scott 's alien is nothing short of a masterpiece . technically brilliant , tense , horrifying and visually breathtaking , there 's not a moment in this b-monster movie that does n't excel well beyond the usual genre trappings .
part iii , however , is not merely a disaster of the most uninspired contrivances but is actually unsuitable for youngsters , the series ' natural audience .
it 's still formulaic , which is no surprise . but no longer is the film forced to spend endless minutes spelling out a character relationship that we already know simply by looking at the poster .
it 's a film ... absent of easy black-or-white ethics , which makes for some powerful emotions . but it 's also a film with nagging problems that add up to a distracting crescendo .
this is on the whole a striking directorial debut , at once scary and erotic , with lots of sidelong touches in the casting , direction , and script .
where apocalypse now once strained for greatness without quite reaching it , this new version of the film , assembled by coppola and his longtime editor , walter murch , has greatness firmly within its grasp .
it 's still a superb film , a rare big budget blockbuster that concentrates on a clever story , crisp performances , and brilliant jokes while using its groundbreaking special effects only as window dressing rather than as the main event .
plucky , likable and determined to succeed , much like its heroine , kit kittredge : an american girl is a throwback to the kinds of movies they do n't make anymore .
those in charge looked at the earlier film and decided ... that there was just too darn much plot . so this time it 's just one tedious mutant smackdown after another
a refreshing change of pace , hot fuzz is more than a spoof flick . it parodies and honors it source material at the same time , and reminds us that dumb action movies are always more fun when sprinkled with a bright -lrb- if not self-aware -rrb- sense of humor
this is bravura filmmaking . it is mobile and muscular , and yet never glorifies its protagonist 's callous , pathetic and often hilariously misfiring bids for a place in the annals of history .
michael douglas could read the telephone book and it would be entertaining . he gives an acting clinic in this character study of a despicable womanizer . the bottom line is an unforgettable lead performance that stays with you long after the ...
as a children 's movie , it 's uncommonly sensitive and complicated , rooted in relationships rather than dazzling action . but adults may notice its simple poetry turning , after a while , to suds .
the little beasties in the new film are computer-generated , reasonably realistic -lrb- way ahead of garfield -rrb- and cute . it 's not their fault the humans , especially jason lee 's dave seville , are excruciatingly boring .
the costumes are phenomenal , the set design ravishing and the sadistic inventiveness extraordinary ; it 's a shame it 's all harnessed to a clich√©d story .
too bad barrymore 's charming personality goes to waste in ever after , a reworking of cinderella with muddled motives and uneven execution .
air guitar nation is a wonderfully wild ride of a documentary , and the greatest trick of the picture is found in how it makes the audience succumb to the power of the sport .
letters from juliet is far from a great movie . but if you 're female or -- like me -- a man with a taste for romance and a fairer deal for our senior citizens , this is one of the year 's guiltiest pleasures .
... writer/director quentin tarantino may have managed to deliver one of the most unflinchingly realistic depictions of slavery in the old south to ever grace the screen . qt 's vision is ugly and twisted and filled with all kinds of evil .
director andrei kravchuk infuses his story with a dickensian mix of benevolence and indifference . the pacing is assured , and his cameras peek through the russian mist as if watching a fairy tale , uncertain of a happy or cruel ending .
even those who never saw cukor 's movie will feel something is missing in english 's version . yes , some of what 's missing is humor and snappy dialogue , but that could be forgiven , if only some of the characters were more believable .
in a cinema landscape where the representation of the black female experience is most visibly explored through the modes of outlandish comedy , unironic melodrama , or not at all , ava duvernay 's take is a decidedly refreshing one .
there 's enough wrong with it -- the uneven pacing , haphazard storytelling , cartoon characters , repeating running gags until they 're predictable and no longer funny , etc. -- that one is bound to wish the film had been better .
there 's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces .
it 's hard to think of a more powerfully uplifting and resonant finale in a film released this year . the title 's black satire becomes superfluous , with this is not a film revealed as the most heartfelt act of defiance .
the age-old plot of good versus evil is so standard that only the best films can warp and bend the idea into a fascinating story .
-lsb- the film -rsb- rubs off a few of the barbed edges from w. somerset maugham 's 1925 novel about love and infidelity in a time of cholera , but no matter : the centerpiece is naomi watts ' outstanding portrayal of an adulteress redeemed .
because we already know how iron man came to be , ` iron man 2 ' is n't quite as interesting as the first film . but it does pack a super-hero wallop of action and fun .
there is a dazzling array of talent on display here , and the film surely has its memorable moments . but it articulates so little of the end-of-an-era feeling it hints at .
it 's never clear about what its intentions are , but it opens up a dialogue , something rare in movies these days . -lsb- full review in spanish -rsb-
this unsettlingly quirky account of semiological breakdown and small-town apocalypse plays like my winnipeg for fans of intellectual horror . pontypool is as astonishing as it is original , and amply repays multiple viewings .
a true amistad movie should be a highly emotional tale about the courage and will of the africans themselves not the american-centered courtroom drama that spielberg has made .
scorch at least feels more like a feature-length film than the maze runner , which played like a sizzle reel for another film that would eventually follow it . it does n't shed all the problems of that prior installment , but it 's a start .
scott and his cinematographer , slavomir idziak , take an already incredible true story and imbue it with a global view and an aesthetic sense that even the soldiers who were there did n't enjoy .
it 's expertly handled , well-written material that knows and understands its many different characters . there are moments in this film that cover the entire emotional spectrum , and not a second is wasted on insincere emotion , making it a real winner .
in its noisy , pointless way , street fighter does come close to the frenetic meandering of a video game scenario -- which is precisely the problem .
... a very derivative and extremely routine would-be sci-fi thriller . the direction moves like lead in water .
another year , another cheesy , hypocritical movie about how the true meaning of christmas gets lost in the madness of christmas . except that this movie is , in itself , exhibit a in the christmas madness category .
cats & dogs has none of the intriguing charm of the babe films -- it fails to establish animal characters we can care about . with few exceptions , the pets are nothing more than furry pawns .
does n't do more than expand a tv show to movie length . however , it 's pleasant enough and its ecological , pro-wildlife sentiments are certainly welcome .
the complications have the appeal of a classic farce , and if the movie 's humor requires a suspension of disbelief , the actors are terrific , and there 's much pleasure in watching the way the drama redoubles and resolves .
there 's something very clinical about the way soderbergh presents the story . but , just when you think it 's going to become some kind of docu-drama , the director slams you back to the ground with human emotion and suffering . paul chambers , cnn , atlanta .
a soaring , endearing adventure feature that plays smart and fierce . now stop giving your money to tim burton 's wheezy imagination and see something with genuine magic . an actual , effective , multi-dimensional wonderland .
though not a musical , `` mommy '' often feels like one as it swells and ebbs on the melodramatic currents of love , pain and frustration . it is also , within its very modest means , formally audacious .
with its unusual look and neatly folding method of storytelling `` the cabinet of dr. caligari '' is an artistically uninhibited silent horror film that still sends chills .
when steven spielberg and tom hanks get together the results can be harrowing and epochal like in saving private ryan or they can be desultory and dull like in the terminal . bridge of spies sits at an unsatisfying spot in between ;
this is a film that will ring true many viewers . the ability of the film to touch ` ordinary ' folk so strongly and honestly is the mark of a true classic .
national lampoon 's animal house is by no means one long howl , but it 's often very funny , with gags that are effective in a dependable , all-purpose way .
splash is a light-hearted comedy directed by ron howard that sparkles here and there thanks to its fairy tale elements .
the movie seems to lurch at times from light to dark , from happiness to horror , from merely sinful to downright savage . intimacy and s&m tastes have that effect on people who are playing out such a strange story .
do you think jiminy glick is funny ? if the answer is no , then you 'll have a hard time spending 90 minutes with the corpulent , star-struck celebrity-interviewer in his debut film , jiminy glick in lalawood .
a fine and fancy delight , a movie that shows off british director mike leigh 's uncanny talent for capturing entire worlds in the smallest details .
within beloved lies a great movie with a powerful message , but its impact is muffled due to the filmmakers ' indulgence and lack of restraint .
the keanu reeves cop movie street kings is a viscerally compelling but thematically confused mess of an action noir that plumbs new depths of cynicism about contemporary american life in general and the los angeles police department in particular .
unnervingly good , little children is one of the rare american films about adultery that feels right -- dangerous , hushed , immediate -- even when the sex takes a back seat to other longings .
the movie exerts an eerie grip , with echoes of bresson , bergman and dreyer , but is utterly distinctive : a vision of a world going inexorably into a final darkness .
this is clearly the work of a master in the making , an artist on the cusp of greatness . farhadi may be fixated on fibbers , but there 's almost no one working today who makes films so emotionally honest .
originally released as braindead , this gory , maccabre satire of 1950s new zealand society is yet another proof that peter jackson is one of the sharpest , most skillful directors working in the genre ; a good companion piece to meet the feebles .
the filmmakers create a zany and surreal world for pee-wee yet it all seems perfectly natural and credible . plus , it 's all infused with a subdued yet rampant silliness that 's enchanting .
dazed and confused is a perfect movie . it flawlessly captures the spirit of the '70s while arguing for a clear universality in the high school experience .
there 's a radical lesson in this story about the ways of permanent government and protect-their-own professionals ... but that 's one that this film is too polite , safe and self-satisfied to ever bring to the screen -- let alone get in focus .
... a superbly executed , whimsical fit of improvisation and cinema verite pastiche that so convincingly created an awful '70s - '80s heavy metal band that the band itself lived on beyond the movie .
larry is n't an evil movie , but it is a symptom of the problems inherent in gross-out humor .
as far as feel-good movies go , this one works in spite of a bloated running length -lrb- over two hours -rrb- and a plot that could use an injection of originality .
writer/director jeff nichols is one to watch . he has fashioned a simple but powerful cautionary tale , equal parts southern gothic and greek tragedy , and has given a familiar kind of material a fresh spin .
lady in the water challenges us to believe in the power of myth . but the big challenge here is surviving the tedium of shyamalan 's meandering inventiveness . what 's supposed to be fanciful storytelling is really just audience punishment .
the film 's structure demands rational and beautiful segues from the real world into fantasia , a ballet of sensibilities that jackson pulls off without a misstep .
this version lacks some of the economy of the first , and , unusually for hitchcock , it sags in the middle . fortunately , there 's a marked improvement as it reaches the last third .
simple , yet complex , this striking contempo western about revenge , is an impressive calling card for patrick hughes in his writing and directing debut
it 's a marvellous culmination of the trilogy , which together make some of the most fascinating stories in film .
though writer/director maggie greenwald wraps her story around a wincingly trite yarn ... she keeps her film afloat by focusing on the music . but , when the tunes stop , so does the magic .
inception is an exhilarating cinematic experience that suggests there is still room , even in the blockbuster world , for big ideas and dangerous emotions , and that may be the single most thrilling thing about it .
every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible . that , in itself , is extraordinary .
the host is wildly entertaining ; people who love the genre will get their geek buttons pushed hard by this flick . but what makes the movie an instant classic is that it 's also , in its dark heart , a furious lampoon .
although carell is never less than likable , he 's funnier in any random scene of the office . here 's hoping some misguided team does n't try to turn that series into a quick grab at box-office bucks 40 years from now .
like hoblit 's primal fear , fallen is a well-made and well-acted film which too often settles for the easy or obvious way to handle a situation .
one of the most loved disney movies that has delighted families since it was made in 1964 , mary poppins , like its central character , is practically perfect in every way .
if anyone can give star wars a run for its money this summer , it 's the horny hero of this very funny comedy .
the movie is a dark comedy about false dreams and lost illusions -- and , thanks to a fine cast and a smart script , it 's an effective one .
this prequel does n't take it much further than the expected offbeat grossness , strident political incorrectness and moments of pleasing -- if uncomfortable -- weirdness .
produced by val lewton and directed by the great jacques tourneur , this was one of the first hollywood horrors to play on the audience 's fears rather than expose it to ghouls and monsters .
there are also a few critics brought in to provide balance , although pollack 's opinion is clear : gehry is a genius . having gazed upon the guggenheim and the disney and sat happily on the grass beneath the spider 's web , i think so , too .
the milieu he chooses -- essentially one long , queerly prosaic car ride to nowhere -- robs the film of much of its dramatic force .
while take shelter is n't by any means perfect - writer/director jeff nichols could use a refresher course on editing - it 's a powerful film , displaying a devolvement into insanity that ultimately proves to be quite visionary .
magnificently stupid with flashes of brilliance . `` 22 jump street '' is a zany action comedy that fizzles a bit at the end , but generates enough laughter to make it a very worthwhile sequel .
it simply aims to keep us on the proverbial seat edge , and it mostly succeeds , even if gajdusek 's twist-filled script has more turnovers than a closely fought football game .
... a rich melange of tumultous and sensual events . the story , acting , direction , set design and costuming fluidly combine to give a passionate portrait of living and loving on the edge of despair in a place and time where there was no tomorrow .
julie gavras 's wonderful film , blame it on fidel , is a deeply political movie that sidesteps strident polemics by viewing the ideological conflicts within a french-spanish family through the eyes of a smart , willful child .
while it has its charms , i never considered disney 's 1950 take on the fairy tale to be worthy of the ` masterpiece ' label the studio slaps on all of its animated features .
a ponderously paced but artistically sure journey ; it 's a film that finds strength in the universality of its ideas and its spiritual dimension , one that 's enlivened by instantly iconic imagery and a keen sense of the strange .
striking in looks but peculiarly disturbing in tone , the futuristic tale that began as a kubrick project and finished under writer-director spielberg is more nightmare than feel-good fantasy .
as a story about two warring families , it is poignant , beautifully shot , and powerful . as an allegory reflecting on the cycles of violence that threaten all of our futures , it is absolutely necessary .
a bubbly but superficial documentary that tells you what you already know -- there was a sexual revolution in the '70s , and its influence on society was both liberating and corrupting .
it 's a refreshing approach to the genre , even when revisiting years later , in an era inundated with superhero movies where each tries to better the last 's visual effects budget .
fellini 's ability to compose a frame that oozes baroque drama and vitality is almost unparalleled and amarcord more or less succeeded for me in evoking a time period through the eyes of a young boy ...
hot rod is pretty dumb , and a good half of its gags fall flat -- but homages to cheesy '80s cinema and television are worth a couple of chuckles .
what 's refreshing is that down with love neatly sidesteps the superior ` modern ' tone that creeps into other notable recent films that depict that era -- think auto-focus and catch me if you can .
quiet and naturalistic in the best way , the french film `` tomboy '' rolls out a tale of malleable pre-adolescent identity with a marked absence of sensationalism .
what could have been a film that exploits a potentially salacious premise for artificially comedic or edgy effect , feels instead like an honest and truthful dissection of the sometimes-strange way modern relationships can work .
the whole point is to just be silly and irreverent with time travel and midlife crisis movies . for it to devolve into gay jokes and f words is a sad disappointment .
director dan rush guides the material with a gentle hand . it 's just overwhelmingly basic , a descriptor that should never apply to a comedic beast of ferrell 's caliber .
if upstream color is not quite the masterpiece we were hoping for , it 's a film with its own affectless mystery and chill .
at least three writers collaborated on a script that drums out loudly its themes of loyalty , honor and revenge , and the finished product dances quickly enough between cliches to make for passable entertainment .
the offbeat beauty of almodovar 's script lies in its seductive combination of grieving , sensuality , fantasy and passion . almodovar is incapable of creating dull characters ...
a hypnotic film that 's as much about the mystique of southeast asia as it is about the insurance-scam plot .
wonderfully complex but warmly human , bergman 's drama is one of his very best .
using a ghostly digital rendition of the actor 's face on a computer screen to embody his words , the filmmakers make brando eerily come alive at times to tell his story . wow . it 's nothing short of transcendent .
as an entertaining look at legal process , this is spellbinding all the way , infused by an ambiguity about human personality and motivation that is preminger 's trademark , and the location shooting is superb .
the flaw in the film is its unrelenting tone of bombast . it never gives you a break . you ache for a moment of quietude , an escape from the lizard king 's cranium .
like to kill a mockingbird , -lsb- it 's -rsb- one of those rare motion pictures that perfectly captures the essence of its source material without compromising it in any way .
it 's an extraordinary folly . a turkey , a pig 's ear , a mad cow of a film . its treatment of bereavement and familial grief is crazier than anything lars von trier came up with in antichrist .
ultimately , mantel and skrovan achieve the goal of reminding a generation that grew up enjoying the protections that nader had spearheaded . but they also frankly acknowledge that the very qualities that made him an incorruptible activist also blinded him .
those who love it as passionately as i do realize this film is about more than dialogue , plot , or space ships . its uniqueness permits it to transcend the ordinary , becoming a movie not about one human but the entire human species .
it 's a well-told , well-mounted movie , though not one that challenges the standard diagnosis of the creative personality .
the result is a dolled-up , overblown , pandering romantic costume drama that 's not only sillier than the filmmakers surely intended but also , if you follow the plot implications all the way to the end , way ickier , too .
i really wanted to like this film . i respect wes anderson and his distinctive voice as a writer-director -lrb- ` rushmore ' is one of my favorite films of the 1990s -rrb- , but this latest endeavor is so precious and self-aware that it nearly smothers itself .
this is an enraging film , as it is meant to be , -lsb- and -rsb- not just because it is a microcosm of rape culture , the collection of pervasive attitudes that rule our society that deny and dismiss men 's violence against women .
-lsb- ghobadi 's -rsb- use of children in peril ... crosses the uneasy line between realism and overt manipulation . still , it 's impossible to deny the sheer shivery force of the film .
araki has put a protective , shimmering patina on a story of abuse and emotional dissonance and the result is an otherworldly , painfully honest movie .
days of thunder does accomplish the job it sets out to do . it 's sometimes funny , sometimes exciting and never too boring or offensive . in a disappointing movie season -- as this one has started out to be -- that can seem like quite an accomplishment .
a solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy .
without the propulsive thrust of either spy game or enemy of the state , two far more engaging movies about government skullduggery , the movie gets bogged down in the same types of twists that carried it through the first half .
angela 's ashes is a gem for the sort of audience that needs no fast-cutting and no contrived conflicts .
a documentary about the lucrative rebirth of disney 's animation arm between the years 1984 and 1994 , it 's a warts-and-all tale of clashing egos and the eternal war between art and commerce .
largely ambitious , and not without flaws , cimino 's oscar winning film is nonetheless an effective chronicle of the impact of vietnam on a clique of close friends
bergmanesque and beautiful , set in a wintry landscape fitfully lit by one woman 's flickering awareness and one man 's long-term , stubborn love , away from her is one of the most remarkable and moving love stories the movies have recently given us .
this overlong and bloated tableaux about corruption , politics , cultural clashes and personal revenge is impressive overall . only when you return to the light of day do you realize the flaws that weigh down scorsese 's would-be epic .
terry gilliam 's most mature film to date demands rigorous analysis from the viewer . add to this the director 's grotesquely comic hallmarks , and the resulting film is a complex and rewarding fantasy .
this is n't one of those labyrinthine works of deception that doubles back on itself at every turn . breach is content to tell a strong story with the utmost efficiency and let its cast do the heavy lifting .
a movie with scope , tremendous clarity of vision and purpose ; simply put , it is a film for the ages , an epic in every sense .
`` elizabeth '' is superior historical soap opera that shrewdly sidesteps all the cliches of british costume drama with its bold , often modern approach .
a trashy , pandering camp homage to the cute quirks of homosexuality .
it remains a testament to the triumphant nature of gondry 's imagination that reality in this movie feels less real than the fantasies . you 're encouraged to mistake one for the other . in some circles , that 's called cinema .
post-modern awareness is mixed with an ancient setting , but the humor still manages to be prehistoric . if you 've always wanted to see smart comedians revert to grade school hi-jinks for cheap laughs , then this is the movie for you .
it 's a great story -- tender without being sentimental , great for kids , engaging for adults , and with a four-legged protagonist who 's as good and decent a hero as you could ask for in hollywood .
thanks to the clarity and cut of past 007 films , sean connery will sparkle forever . but with a dearth of action and only a fat paycheck as motivation , `` diamonds '' feels less like a triumphant return and more like a cheesed-up cabaret version of bond .
as a standalone movie , it is a memorable entry in scorsese and newman 's filmographies . but as a companion piece to the hustler , it is an exceptional example on how to revisit an iconic character with respect , and above all , with a healthy new vision .
both a history lesson on the birth and death of an american city and a portrait of people who refuse to give up on a dream . it is also a grass-roots ecological tract made up of equal parts science , folklore and kitschy nostalgia .
seductively shot and beautifully acted , this is like a summation film , bringing together all the themes , motifs , mood , and style of the gritty policier hong kong thriller , one that will make john woo and michael mann proud .
aspires to the whimsy and fantasy of the wizard of oz but does n't really capture the magic ... more a fond tribute to ` pure imagination ' than a triumph of it .
while the movie 's main concern -- skewering bourgeois hypocrisy -- is not particularly fresh or innovative , chabrol 's craft is so precise , his way with actors and the camera so sure-handed , even this ordinary story is often immensely enjoyable .
there is n't an original moment in the mix , but it 's not as crass or vulgar as much of what passes for ` family friendly ' entertainment , and it keeps the precocious pop-culture references to a blessed minimum .
this comedy for adults -lrb- no children , animals , or f/x -rrb- offers an inside , nasty look at the fashion world that 's vastly entertaining , with the glitzy glamour and bitchy women fights that would make cukor proud .
is it a droll drama ? a dark comedy ? let 's just say that the film 's startling shifts in mood fit this movie about a man and country divided . and that it appears to be padrino to the godfather .
it 's hard to take this movie seriously . it 's the cinematic equivalent of dotting your i 's with a big heart , a very youngish view of life and death in which everything is too neatly wrapped up with a bow .
considering the abstract nature of its subject , scott walker : 30 century man is a surprisingly straightforward look at a man who 's been at the cutting edge of music 's avant garde for decades .
it can and will be seen as ` patriotic , ' a tribute to the armed forces . but it is also , in its clear-eyed depiction of the chaos and carnage of battle , of the soldiers ' quaking fear , and the cruel finality of a bullet or a bomb , very much an antiwar film .
while the script throws a few spiritual contrivances our way , it 's a fun and tense watch and a promising start for the ` shyamalan presents ' marque .
a smart , cool movie that not only admits its tv origins but celebrates them .
with its great turns by donat , carroll -lrb- the original hitchcock blonde -rrb- and all the cast , and immaculate direction of a cracking script , this is timelessly enjoyable . a true classic .
cedar 's film traffics in the mad illogic of battles whose long-forgotten purpose has hardened into mindless routine . but this hushed , atmospheric mood piece , intricately scripted by cedar and novelist ron leshem , is no action picture .
repetitive in its own right as well as in terms of its origins , -lsb- rec -rsb- 2 is well made but never remotely scary -- the cardinal sin of any horror movie .
it 's a strained , sexless , and overcooked film ... dalton 's game , but the film is inert , perhaps unprepared to work with the new irish kiss direction of the series .
the movie wenders and juliano have made is a tribute that feels both grand and modest in scale : just as salgado 's photographs do , it extends the notion of friends and family to include every citizen of the world .
amir bar-lev 's documentary is fascinating on all kinds of levels : as a movie about the nature of art , the lure and pitfalls of celebrity , and the complicated conundrums of parenting .
there 's no denying the warmth of schneebaum 's encounters , or his engaging nature . or the fact that you 've never seen a documentary quite like this one , and are n't likely to again .
something funny happens . just when in her shoes threatens to become a movie of bold-faced hysterics , it morphs into a quiet , thoughtful picture marked by subtle acting and good character work .
with its eco-trappings , car chases and fights , the film feels very sub-quantum of solace . the fact that quantum itself felt very sub-bourne says even less for transporter 3 . even if you 're a statham fan , this series is starting to feel tired .
veering from comedy to moving tragedy to a bittersweet ending , talk to me captures the spirit of a man and the times in which he lived . it may not be a masterpiece , but it 's pretty damned close .
despite the familiar plot elements ... in the line of fire is not a retread but a smart , tense , well-made thriller -- eastwood 's best in the genre since tightrope .
a little preachy and a little dry , the film nevertheless manages to prick your interest and your conscience -- and to raise your ire toward the folks who created this wondrous technology and then obliterated it .
some folks consider it the best thing disney ever did , a sweet story filled with rollicking gags , tuneful music , yet sadness and heartache , too .
full of joy , color and detail , ` the book of life ' is like no other movie . family-friendly , but not necessarily a ` kid flick , ' this film truly is a work of art .
the pic functions well as both a prison escape drama and as an escapist film . it 's far from a great film , but is entertaining and pleasantly cynical despite being so bleak .
it 's easy to drift away from the story and become absorbed in minnelli 's impossibly delicate textures , but there is a little something here for everybody .
lukas moodyson 's debut feature has a grainy , immediate feel that nicely enhances the story 's emotional honesty -- a quality that our own popular teen movies have only just begun to embrace .
-lsb- burton 's -rsb- dark , melancholy vision is undeniably something to see , but it is a claustrophobic conception , not an expansive one , oppressive rather than exhilarating , and it strangles almost all the enjoyment out of this movie without half trying .
s√©raphine may be one of the spookiest , most unsettling films ever made about the hazy line between art and madness . that 's a theme the movies have done to death , yet it finds new life in the title performance by yolande moreau .
a warm-heartened riff on the tried-and-true rocky formula , and one of the better cinematic icons of the 1980s .
fans of this kind of deadpan humor are guaranteed to get a few chuckles out of this one . all of the actors are marvelously horrible , and in this movie , bad equals good .
the best way to describe the action packed film ` colombiana ' is to say to that it 's mindless , unpretentious , very stylized , and entertaining . it 's your typical b film brought to the big screen by the power and influence of luc besson .
a repulsive and forgettable serial killer movie from down under , without a trace of plot , character or theme that would take us beyond the ... gore .
that human touch is what distinguishes in the shadow of the moon from run-of-the-mill documentaries and is a timely reminder , in these dark days , that mankind is capable of much that is good .
in its telling , the love story draws from westerns , musicals , film noir , chase thrillers with stunts so preposterous they verge on parody -- and it gets away with everything because of basu 's visual bravura and unstinting passion and energy .
at the level of serious film criticism , it 's a meditation on the myths in our movies : christmas , families , monsters , retail stores , movies , boogeymen . at the level of pop moviegoing , it 's a sophisticated , witty b movie .
a hilarious film in places , paced perfectly for laughs , but it 's also a poignant portrait of a guy who just wants to be a more conventional kind of movie star .
disney 's first attempt to make a disney world attraction into a film -lrb- the haunted mansion and pirates of the caribbean are soon to follow -rrb- is n't great , but it 's surprisingly unwretched .
those with a taste for bone-crushing martial arts executed with real skill and flair are not likely to find anything better on american screens for some time .
... plays like a drunken mash-up of beckett , troma and hitchcock . dupieux knows how to riff on the behavior and language of cinema but is n't clever or outlandish enough to sustain his film 's 85-minute running time .
it 's both a brilliant piece of visionary filmmaking and a deeply romantic love story , and while charlie kaufman 's script will undoubtedly become required film-school reading , it 's the performances that really make it play .
von trotta 's style is pretty stolid . she aims for documentary thoroughness rather than exhilarating drama . nonetheless , it 's good to see a film that gets its narrative charge from the ferment of intellectual debate . it 's a rare breed .
any new vampire film needs fresh blood , and this one is clotted with clich√©s , including its matrix-style acrobatics .
