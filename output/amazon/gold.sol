nice boots but run a bit narrow . they look great but i think the quality has come down over the years . still comfortable but i wish they broke in easier . i recommend these for any lady who is patient and looking for comfort .	these boots run fairly true-to-size , but they are n't super easy to get on at first . they 're comfortable , but a short break-in period is needed , at least in my experience . they look great on and they 're very durable , but they are not the lightest boots you can wear . as long as you are n't expecting feather light footwear , this should n't be a problem . they are a nice blend of function and fashion and that 's not always easy to find in boots .	these boots are great , excellent quality , incredibly comfortable and the sizes are exact . it 's a little expensive , but will last me for about twenty years . the shipping was fast , two days . i love it .
very pretty shoes and nice quality . the shoes run a bit small , about half a size and there is a ridge in the shoe that rubs on your toe . nice formal night shoe , not so much for every day .	great fast amazon shipping . this shoe is very chic , classic and with a rich color that blends with almost any navy blue colored outfit . i love the look of the shoes and would be forever special to me . there is a rim inside the topmost part of the shoes that could cause blister to my toes .	these shoes are best fit and nice looking for parties or specially for wedding functions . the toe of the show can be a challenge for some feet and may make the feet sore due to the rim to keep the shape perfect . overall price wise and looks are great and would recommend for long term use .
the necklace is very unique and a great quality for the price . the charm is n't exactly what is pictured as far as size goes but still very beautiful . the chain is a bit thin but seems to have good durability . overall i would recommend this to anyone looking to add a beautiful piece to their jewelry collection .	this necklace is beautiful and well-made for the price . even though the chain is thin it has n't broken . the pendant is really nice , but it is hard to tell the size from the photos . it would look great around the neck of any woman you get it for !	this necklace is a beautiful and unique piece to add to your own or a loved one 's jewlery collection . the pendant is unique and the bail is a ring making this sterling silver necklace an elegant looking piece . it has a very strong chain also so it can be shown off and enjoyed for a long time .
the suit fits ok on me , it is good around the waist but tight in the legs/thighs . i will probably return this and move up a size , it 's easier to use the drawstring on the waist than deal with a swimsuit strangling my thighs . consider a larger size than normal if you have large thighs .	this suit is a good fit for me . it may fit tight on guys with large thighs . i like the feel of this suit and the style is good for anyone swimming as a workout or doing any real training . it may run a bit small though it does seem to stretch at the seams with use and wear .	the suit tends to run a bit small as the fitting in the waist was adequate but it was tight in the thighs . after heavy use the seams tend to loosen up and even loose the elasticity over time . overall it 's a nice suit , has a nice feel , and is nicely constructed .
`` this is the perfect `` '' comfy shoe , '' '' great for walking around town or casual get togethers . cute and functional ! they do run a bit big , plan to order them 1/2-1 size smaller than usual . another very comfortable shoe by ahnu , would definitely buy again ! ''	these shoes are lightweight , comfortable , have plenty of support , and are slip resistant . they 're great for walking and working , and they look quite nice as well . the only issue is that their size measurements seem inaccurate . you may end up needing to get a size that is either smaller or larger than what you normally get .	nice , lightweight , comfortable shoes for casual use like walking- if they fit you well . sizing is confusing , tends to run large and not fit well on wider feet . expect to need 1/2 size to 1 full size smaller than your normal shoe size . try these on in person if possible !
i love these sandals , dansko has made a really great product ! i had to return my first pair ( 39 ) for being a bit tight and small , but i went a size higher ( 40 ) and it is perfect , they are so comfortable ! if they do stretch out like other reviews say , they will still fit and look great .	i love these dansko tasha sandals ! they are comfortable and the style is really cute . the only warning i have is that they seem to run narrow : you may want to buy a larger size if you have wide feet . also , they seem to stretch as you wear them , so do n't get discouraged by a few blisters on first wearing .	these dansko shoes are amazingly comfortable and hug the shape of my feet well , but i did have to wear them for a bit to stretch them out . they felt a little tight at first , but now they are perfect . i feel they 're true to size so i 'd recommend ordering these in your normal shoe size .
these look very nice on . the mesh in them run a little tight though so you may want to go up in size . they are roomy in the pockets and can hold onto a lot of items . they are a great price for the quality and i would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a new pair of swim trunks .	these swim trunks look great and the waist fits as expected for the size . they are also a good deal for the price . however , the inner mesh liner is much smaller than the size of the outer trunks . you will probably have to cut out the mesh liner to wear them comfortably .	these are nice fitting shorts but the mesh liner felt tight and i cut it out . you might want to size up if you are unsure . the deep pockets come in handy . these shorts are stylish and they look good . they are more comfortable if the inner mesh liner is removed .
these are lightweight , durable and supportive shoes . they look great and the cushion is quite comfortable . they are perfect for people who have to stand on their feet all day . they feel lightweight on the foot and are great for people with regular sized foot . however , they may not work for someone with very wide feet . overall , i would recommend these to anyone who needs a supportive comfortable shoe .	i love the look of these shoes , and everyone in my walking group has commented on how great they look ! i took the advice of others and ordered a size smaller . they fit just right and are very comfortable . i walk for two hours , 4 times a week , and these shoes have been just what i need .	i love these shoes ! they give me great arch support and are very well-made . they fit pretty true to size , but make sure you utilize the sizing chart listed . they are perfect for my daily walk . i love the color . i did get a blister the first time i wore them , but that always happens to me . they just need to be broken in . now they are the most comfortable shoes i have ever had .
these are silver discs , not the gold ones as advertised . the packaging is not good , they need to be packed more securely , the dvds should n't be able to slide around . the quality of the dvds is hit or miss . you might have a good batch and then run into several that wo n't work .	i 've always used hp dvd + r discs , but these are silver instead of the gold they used to be . these silver ones are hit or miss . i 'll burn 10 dvds no problem , then get a few coaster in a row . i wish the gold dvd + r were still around . i 'm glad i bought the 100 pack in case i have any other issues .	these dvds work well for the most part , although i did get some coasters . some seem to work but become choppy about 30 minutes into the video . hp is still better than most other brands though . take note that these are silver , not gold . hopefully the vendor updates their images .
overall impression of the product is negative . in some cases it works nicely , but the settings are confusing to adjust , sometimes it is not clear if they do anything at all . product is not worth the money that it costs , it better to avoid it .	the product is easy to use . it converted to digital format my slide and photo negatives . very efficient and user friendly tool . it is mostly compatible for windows xp . the product is not recommended for today 's market .	i seems that the vupoint scanner seems like a good product but between the inconpatable software and trouble with placing the negatives in , many customers dont have the time and want instant results . i would give this scanner a good review if you cant afford a more high product . you wont get a better enhancement feature on a more higher end scanner . give it a try or return it if you dont like it
if you are looking for a basic intercom system and nothing fancy , then this product is for you . it is perfect for what i need it for . they do not come with cords , so make sure you have batteries . it has a good range of coverage . all units work well , and the setup was easy as described in the manual . they are simple to use and my kids love them ! great product for the price .	these intercoms are not worth the buy . getting these set up is quite the hassle and the instruction manual is not much aid . the worst part is that the sound quality is very poor . this may have some use if a simple message is to be sent . otherwise , do n't waste your money .	this does not come with an ac charger so you have to use batteries or buy a cord separately . i think this covers a good distance and the battery life seems good . the audio is not great , it is not very clear . it is challenging to set up . walkie talkies would work about as well .
the charger gets very hot with use , which can be quite concerning . the fit into the laptop is often loose , which makes it unreliable . some items delivered did n't resemble the photo online . overall , it would be best to avoid this product and buy direct from the manufacturer .	this charger gets very hot very fast and it seems a bit dangerous . it has to be lined up a certain way to work . the charger makes a bit of noise . customer service was not helpful . a cooling device may help with the heat but this product should be used with caution . it is an affordable option .	this product is of very poor quality . this charger is not reliable . it gets very hot and is loud and may ruin your device . it does not look the product in the description and customer service is not quick to help . overall , i definitely do not recommend this product .
you get what you pay for with this receiver . terrible radio reception , very noisy fan , and do n't expect any help from the useless manual . it does have decent power , but i 'd rather pay a bit more for a quality product .	this is an inexpensive stereo option . the manual is limited and is difficult to read , also the fan is loud . the radio reception is poor quality . the sound quality though is great , when listening to sirius or when hooked up to a laptop .	this sound system is worth the cost . the bass is so clear and loud , the stereo works fantastic and the range of sound adjustment is great . i had a problem setting the channel preset . overall , it 's a sweet deal .
exactly as described . looks good with a solid build and the unit is quite sturdy . this unit locks in very tightly and also feels professional . it is a great purchase for the money . i 'd recommend this handle highly .	this stabilizer is perfect for light weight cameras and can also be used with a cell phone to help diminish jitter . you can feel the heft in this stabilizer and know that it will stay secure . it feels weighty and professional . i would say to use caution when using it with larger cameras but it is perfect for smaller cameras . overall , it is recommended .	a great all-around , sturdy stick for cameras . it is very versatile and quite ideal for lightweight cameras especially , and this stick is highly recommended for its great price-point and overall versatility .
this camera is easy to use and you can take it anywhere . the picture quality is generally great . some things to note are that it does not include an sd card and there have been instances of issues regarding the on / off button , they can seem a little small . it also holds it 's own against more expensive cameras . overall this small but easy to use camera takes great pictures so it is recommended with confidence .	i like this camera for its picture taking and size . takes professional photos and it is very easy to use . it 's low light feature is outstanding and helpful in venues that flashes are not allowed . i love this camera .	if you are a beginning photographer and wan good pictures i suggest buying this nikon camera . it does not come with an sd card which is not cool for the money i spent and they can be pretty pricey . if you need low light capability on your camera , than this is the one for you it seems to have a feature for every scene or situation
this fm/am radio , iphone docking station and alarm clock is a perfect combination ! the sound is amazing , the alarm clock is not annoying , and the design looks great ! it would be nice to have a place to use an aux cord and certain apple products require a $ 5 adapter to use the docking station but other than that , this product is fantastic !	this is a great product . it has amazing sound quality , and the dual-band feature is nice . i love the fact that it charges my device while it 's docked . not only is this thing functional , but it also looks great and does n't take up a lot of space . overall , i would advise buying this if your needs call for an awesome speaker that doubles as a charging station .	this is exactly what i 've been looking for ! it has great sound quality and it 's really easy to dock my iphone in it ( it charges my phone at the same time ! bonus ) the alarm is easy to use and does it 's job . some iphones and ipods will need an adapter , so make sure to check that out first .
this product is good alternative to deodorants . crystal lasts a long time . the major drawback is that it is somewhat easy to drop the product and it shatters very easily . overall the product withstood the test of time	this stuff works , fantastic product . i used to doubt it at first when i heard about it , but now i believe in this product . it is still working after purchase about a year ago . it 's cheap , keeps me smelling good and does n't irritate my skin . it can be difficult to hold on to and slippery , but it is money well spent . i highly recommend it .	economically priced with long lasting results and truth that a little goes a long way , this crystal rock deodorant is a great deal . users are pleased with the crystals ability to eliminate body odor even for heavy perspirers . recommended for those who want to get away from the traditional stick , though be careful for if dropped it will shatter so also may be best purchased in-store versus ordering online .
a good product , compares to the original very good , for the fraction of the size . very convenient when traveling or living in the dorm , since the space is an issue there . there was no power cord , so that should be kept in mind . much better than nose generating apps .	this sound machine is small , battery powered , and compact . it does not come with a power adapter , so be prepared with batteries wherever you plan to use it . there is only one sound programmed into the machine – a sound mixture of rain and water . this is great to aid sleep , relaxation in the office , or nurseries .	this sound machine is the perfect size for traveling . it is quite compact , and it can be powered with the adapter or batteries . it offers a small variety of rain and other water effects , and will be loud enough for most people . if you have a larger room or a super noisy environment , the volume might not be high enough for you .
very good heart monitor if you do n't need advanced features , that would be used mainly by professionals . very easy use . the drawbacks are , bad or no included manual , but manual is accessible on the internet . and only four digits on the display , so if you run more than an hour that could be an issue . overall recommended	this heart rate monitor is very user friendly for beginners . very easy to use straight out of the box . however , this product comes with an instruction booklet and internet instructions if you need help with initial set up . you can program your target heart rate and there is an audible beep when you are in or fall out of target range . very easy to read display which can also has a backlight . the only drawback is the log will only store the last workout data . overall a very nice beginner heart rate monitor .	this is a good monitor , it is easy to use and well-made . the product is for you , if you are in need of a heart rate monitor . it is fairly accurate and warns you should in case you fall out of a target heart range . the battery is not replaceable and screen easily scratches .
while it 's not full proof , this spray is great at reducing the number of wrinkles in cotton and polyester materials . it 's less effective on thicker materials . it 's quick and easy to use , and it has a nice scent . it 's a good thing to bring on vacation to freshen up packed clothes . just be aware , the bottle is prone to leaking !	this is an awesome wrinkle release product , with a nice aroma . when applied , wrinkles disappear from your clothes . the package arrived in a bad condition , it 's not perfect , but quite presentable . i love it .	when my bottle arrived , it had leaked a bit in the bag , but i still had about 3/4 to use . it smells amazing ! i have always really hated ironing , so it 's a good substitute for that , but only on my shirts . any work pants that have wrinkles , i still have to turn on the iron . however , it really seems to reduce static when ironing , so it 's still handy that way ! overall it 's not as great as advertised , but it 's still pretty useful . order with caution though , leakage seems to be a common occurrence .
this product is innovative and works ! it keeps your glasses with you and the strong magnet lasts . everyone that i 've shown this to decides that they need one too . the only problems are that the small pieces can occasionally fall off , and the glasses do n't always stay if you bend over . otherwise , this is a great product that is especially useful if you tend to misplace your glasses .	this lived up to expectations after the product was featured on shark tank . the magnet is very strong , and will work anywhere on clothing . glasses wo n't slip or fall . however , those with pacemakers should avoid due to the strong magnet . overall , recommend .	these magnetic eyeware retainers attach firmly to your clothes and keep your glasses within reach when you 're not wearing them . though they normally keep a strong grip , it is possible in some circumstances for your glasses to fall out . also , i am unsure if the product will last very long .
this is an excellent product ! just as advertised , it eliminates foot odor and on top of that the insole is so thin it can be used in multiple types of shoes including heels . very comfortable and well worth the price to have soft odor free feet after wearing shoes !	while they are a little thin which can be an issue , the insoles work really well at keeping odor away and fits really well in most shoes . while cheaper ones do exist on the market , these ones have been great at battling the issues i had before using these insoles .	these odor-absorbing insoles work very well ! the thin insoles fit well into many kinds of footwear and they are also easy to trim down if they are too large . they help to absorb odor and wetness all day . , and may even extend the life of my shoes .
great insert for the price , works well with my zippo case . it uses butane , which is cleaner burning as well as convenient . thunderbird is a fantastic alternative to the more pricey zippo inserts . it holds a big flame , too , and it 's easily adjustable .	this butane conversion allows for the case of a classic zippo to clean burning butane lighter . it allows for flame height adjustments and holds its flame well . it is a durable and reliable product that holds up well to wear and use . while this is not a licensed zippo product it is important to note that its fit is not guaranteed .	when i ordered this , i did n't know what to expect . i 'm pleasantly surprised . it 's plastic , but very convenient and the unit fits very well into my zippo case . you can fine tune your preference as the torch adjusts very nicely . it works great . i also had issues with closing the cap of zippo .
this magnesium supplement is very good for the money . helps to improve the mood , to make sleep better . the price is a better deal than the competitor products . especially if you buy in bulk . one thing , it does not taste like a calm product , so you should keep that in mind . recommended .	this product has been helpful for my everyday aches and pains . i found that i can easily mix it into my morning smoothies , juice or even plain almond milk without any weird taste or fizzing . the product came very well packaged and i love the resealable bag for easy storage.all in all a great product .	the bulksupplements pure magnesium citrate powder is a unique product in its own right . as it does dissolve well , it has a lot of health benefits such as calming down , arthritis . as it comes in a liuid form i prefer the powder for some weird reason . with it being so affordable , ordering this in a large amount is preferred for me and lastly with it being so concentrated it can last for a long time
this kitchen steamer is based on a classic design , works very well and is convenient to use . it can steam a variety of foods , from vegetables and starches , to seafood and eggs . it 's rather large , which can be an issue if your counter space is limited . overall , highly recommended .	this steamer is an excellent product . it does wonderful when cooking rice , boiling eggs , steaming vegetables and more ! it makes clean up a breeze and even has a handy screen for putting seasoning in what your cooking . definitley a nice addition to any kitchen !	this is a very nice and roomy steamer . it has plenty of space to steam multiple items or even just one . it is on the larger side so it is hard to store when not in use . all the food that is steamed in it comes out perfect and clean up is easy . i would recommend this to anyone .
buying a new dustbuster is unnecessary when in reality just cleaning or replacing the filters will do the job just fine . amazon also provides added risk by recommending dustbusters that do n't fit with certain filters .	i bought these because i know that these filters are the ones i need . i 've bought them before , but amazon repeatedly tells me that i need a different filter . i think their bought together section is messed up , so do n't buy this filter just because amazon says to . anyways , these filters have always worked well for me .	`` before purchasing this product , i highly suggest checking your vaccumn to see what type of filters will fit . amazon lists this product with several cyclone vaccumns under the `` '' commonly purchased together '' '' section and that is not correct . this filter wilk not work in just any cyclone vaccumn . if this fliter actually fits in your vaccumn , its a great product and will last a long time if you take care of it and rinse it off occassionally . ''
the picture size is perfect , and the quality is great . it 's a wonderful tool for teaching a child about the solar system . there is an educational summary for every planet . however , it is slightly dated since pluto is still included , but you can just tell your child pluto retired from its position as a planet . it 's also not laminated , but we put it in a frame and it looks really nice on the wall .	this poster is great for teaching children about the solar system . it is informative and easy to understand . it does not come with a frame . the quality is not the best and may be difficult to read from far away . overall , i recommend the poster despite the quality because the price is very low .	the poster is a little outdated because it still lists pluto as a planet , but it is a beautiful poster . there are some concerns regarding the quality of the shipping as there was the issue of it not being laminated and also having wrinkles .
good deal on these tables and chairs ! may come in separate packages but they will be well protected . color may vary from what you see on the website so be aware . easy assembly . seems durable enough . great option for a small living space .	the dinning room set is very sturdy , seats are very comfortable and has a nice color . great for small area , but i will not advice usage for a large eating area . it looks great and it is easy to put together . the top scratches easily . it was delivered on time and i 'm pleased with the purchase .	the product is very easy to assemble . the size and colors are nice , fit in a small room . the major drawback of the product is that it often comes damaged , probably when shipping . scratches , broken parts , even completely unusable sets are common .
this is a beautiful kettle even though it appears smaller and the color is a little off from the ads and it may seem a bit smaller but otherwise it looks very nice . something to keep in mind of though is the handle seems unable to handle too much heat as it is can melt easier than you 'd think .	the color is great . it works fine as a teapot , but the handle is plastic , so it ca n't withstand high temperatures . i had difficulty removing the lid , but got better after some days . i 'm quite happy with it though .	this teapot is cheaply made with a plastic handle , it 's not true to color ( dark blue instead of turquoise ) . the lid is really tight , adding to the frustration . save yourself a return and look elsewhere for a better product .
great value machine . after a few trial runs , you can make the perfect tortilla . it can also make an array of other edibles such as crepes and pizza crusts . it is not so good for dough that requires air pockets as it is a press , but for tortillas , it 's great . customer service is very responsive and helpful .	the cucinapro tortilla maker is worth the money . it 's a bit tricky at first , but once you get the hang of it , you get fresh , homemade tortillas that taste great . it works just like the more expensive presses . their customer service is fantastic , very helpful . i would recommend this to any home cook .	i love this tortilla maker . it 's fun , easy to use and easy to clean up too . the machine performs same function as a 3000 dollar tortilla press but has no automatic operation . this product also have a good customer service as it replaced a defective one within a week .
this fan is a great size as it does n't take up too much space . however , the airflow does n't come out from the middle rather it comes out from the sides . because of this , you have to play with the position to get the benefits of the cooling aspect . i would not recommend this for daily use .	this is a cheap fan that does n't work well . air only comes out of one side , instead of out the front , and is very weak . you ca n't use oscillate if you wa n't to feel any blowing air . i do n't recommend this fan . spend a little more money and get one that is much better .	i bought this fan to keep right next to me when i 'm working at my desk or reading , and for this purpose , it works great . there 's plenty of airflow for a personal fan , but if you are trying to cool a room , this is not a good option . the air only comes out one side for some reason , so i do need to angle it appropriately . it also does not oscillate , but i knew that it did n't have that feature when i ordered it . it 's a bit noisy , so probably not ideal for a super quiet office environment .
the steamer is ideal for making single servings of veggies . i am not able to use this to make large batches at once . it is easy and quick to clean . however , the product is very flimsy and it is easy to spill the food . overall , i would not recommend this because of the mess that it makes .	this steamer is perfect for someone cooking a single serving for themselves . anyone cooking for anyone other than themselves , however , will probably not enjoy this product as it is very small and only cooks a small portion at a time . also , it is made of silicone so the flimsy material causes spills if you are not careful and it is very hot when you pull it out of the microwave .	if you love steamed veggies this is the dream steamer you should have at home . the steamer takes less space in kitchen and very quick to steam all kind of veggies . very easy to to use and easy to clean . it will steam veggies for a serving for two people at a time .
